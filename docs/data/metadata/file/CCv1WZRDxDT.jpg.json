I never thought I\u2019d see the day I would need to stand in defiance against my government. Newsom has overstepped his authority by ignoring our Constitutional rights to practice our faith and to peaceably gather.\n\n\u2022\n\nFor individuals who feel it is better for them to isolate, social distance, or wear face masks, please do so. I respect everyone\u2019s decision, will respect anyone\u2019s physical boundaries, and will not shame anyone for their decision. But I will not bend my knee to fear, listen to the lies of the media that are causing mass panic and fear, or allow my praise to be silenced.\n\n\u2022\n\nI encourage every church in California to stand with us.\n\n\u2022\n\n#unconstitutional #wecanmovemountains #walkawaymovement #1stamendment #civilunrest #recallnewsom #faucifraud #informationwarfare #americafirst\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 #saveamerica #governornewsom #antimask #gavinnewsomsucks #drfauci #faucifraud #plandemic2020 #wedonotconsent #letschangethenarrative #agentsofchange #exitthematrix #masksdontwork #coronahoax2020 #deepstateexposed #plandemic2020 #saveamerica #wherewegoonewegoall #antimask #fauci #faucifraud #nomasks #wedonotconsent",
