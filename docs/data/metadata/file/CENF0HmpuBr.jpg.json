    "description": "\u201cThe tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions & fallout.\nThere are weapons which are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices- to be found only in the minds of men. \n\nFor the record, prejudices can kill, and suspicion can destroy, and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own- for the children and the children yet unborn. And the pity of it is that these things cannot be confined to The Twilight Zone.\u201d\n\n[closing narration: \u201cThe Monsters Are Due on Maple Street\u201d, Twilight Zone episode that aired March 4th, 1960.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#covid1984 #orderoutofchaos #kill5G #mandatoryvaccinations #chaosbydesign #operationmockingbird #fight5G #eugenics #contacttracing #maskhole #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #transhumanistagenda #artificialintelligence #problemreactionsolution #scamdemic #conspiracyreality #covidiots #5G #geoengineering #climatechangehoax #wtc7 #soros #billgates #rothschild #rockefeller #depopulation #technocracy #electromagneticwaronhumanity",
