My heart broke when I finally realized the world wouldn\u2019t change before I graduated high school or maybe even in my lifetime.\n\u2800\nSo I learned to cope. Focus on my art and my creativity to help ME heal and pray that that healing could touch the world.\n\u2800\nBut that doesn\u2019t make living in THIS world any easier. Black people are tied together through a generational thin thread that cuts deep every single time we lose someone to HATE and FEAR.\n\u2800\nI\u2019m just tired. Tired of patching myself up after every murder. George...Ahmaud...Breonna I carry you with me.\n\u2800\nWhile the world only has to deal with the CORONAVIRUS. Black people still have to deal with #Racism and #PoliceBrutality. Smh The attack on our people never stops. \n#GeorgeFloyd\n#AhmaudArbery\n#SeanReed\n#BreonaTaylor \n#POPULATIONCONTROL \n#corona  #coronavirus  #Hr6666 #TraceAct #COVID19 #Shutdown #Martiallaw #quarantine  #pandemic #5G #Vaccination\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"\"fair use\"\" for purposes such as criticism. commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
