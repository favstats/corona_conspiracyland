    "description": "Reposted from @benswann_ FB's so called \u201cfact checkers\u201d have struck again, claiming that my report on the science that proves that wearing facemasks, especially in non-medical settings does almost nothing to prevent the spread of a virus, is false\u2026 citing that it was based on old information. Now, I'm reporting on a new study created in conjunction with the World Health Organization and published by the CDC from less than 60 days ago that once again proves that there is no evidence that wearing face masks in public prevents the spread of flu-like viruses. I'm also going to show you why the Facebook fact-checking system cannot be trusted.\n\nLink to the CDC published study. This study was conducted in preparation for the development of guidelines by the World Health Organization on the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions for pandemic influenza in nonmedical settings.\n\nThis study was supported by the World Health Organization. \n  https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article?fbclid=IwAR3ASxBUrRE5LHeZsZF-iHrpTuX2PprS8FnkKGUpEUDEIAnH6s5wQOpkOJI - #regrann #FireFauci #AnthonyFauci #BillGates #GatesFoundation #vaccines #CoronaVirus #Covid19 #DonaldTrump #CNN #BBC #FoxNews #MSNBC #ABC #CBS #NBC #WHO #CDC",
