A group of authors from the CDC and Kaiser Permanente reported in the May 15 issue of the CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report that there was a \u201csharp decline in provider orders for vaccines as well as a decline in pediatric vaccine doses administered.\u201d\n\nLower infant deaths associated with stopping vaccinations in babies also was noted by a doctor in Italy in a letter to Robert F. Kennedy of Children\u2019s Health Defense. Dr. Antonietta M. Gatti wrote that during the lockdown there were no sudden-infant-death syndromes. After the lockdown, baby vaccination started again, and there was a dead baby in Turin, and another child and two twins died.\n\nReposted from @spidernetcontrol\n\n\u2022\n\nArticle: https://healthchoice.org/lessons-from-the-lockdown/\n\n\u2022\n#drfauci #fauci #firefauci #prolifegeneration #exvaxxer #humanrights #scamdemic #plandemic #mybodymychoice #nomask #medicalfreedom #religiousfreedom #agenda21 #nonewnormal #wakeupamerica #mybodymychoice #billgatesiseveil #childrensrights #CDC #bigpharma #crunchymoms #gatesofhell  #endthelockdown #clintonfoundation #exvaxxer #holistichealth #donttreadonme #worldhealthorganization #emergencyroom #gatesfoundation #covid1984",
