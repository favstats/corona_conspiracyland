    "description": "I am currently watching Cuomo talk about masks, yet again, in his stupid briefing. He's talking about how NYers are tough. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 WHAT A CROC OF SHIT!! Tough people don't hide behind masks. They fight with their fists, their minds and their courage. If anything, NYers are pussies. Red states ARE TOUGH! Trump is TOUGH!!! And man, when they reopen NY and everyone is trotting around in their masks and inhaling poisonous CO2 for months, it'll be a hilarious sight to see all these morons get severely sick in the Fall. Also, Cuomo got a tan and a haircut and went to the dentist while you're sitting at home watching The Real Housewives and eating cheetos. And AGAIN, Cuomo is blaming Trump for his own decisions. If anyone has a source where Trump ordered Cuomo to put Covid patients in nursing homes, pls DM me a link. I call bullshit on that.\ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26\n#covidiots #covidhoax #conspiracies #nyc #reopenamerica #conspiracytheory #fearmongering #reopenusa #reopennyc #truth #facts #plandemic #agenda21 #scamdemic #antivax #filmyourhospital #fakenews \n#lockdown #medialies #endlockdown #government #spiritualwarfare\u00a0 #governmentlies #woke #constitution #humanrights \n#wakeup #sheeple #cuomosucks #trump2020",
