Rockefeller dumped a load of oil money to create the evil that is big pharma. He also funded universities which aimed to teach medicine in a way which suited one purpose. Profit. Those books you read in class, those lectures you so tireless attended... all under the notion of treatment and symptoms rather than the prevention of the cause. I\u2019ll repeat that. All modern medicine is based on treatment of the symptoms rather than prevention of the cause.\n\nWell what is the cause? Most doctors and scientist are openly admitting they don\u2019t know the cause of most illnesses. They simply don\u2019t know, so their solution is primarily to treat symptoms. The system is not set up for our best interest. As unfortunate as that is, it only means one thing. We must take health and healing into our own hands.\n\nGerm theory, and now the term \u201cvirus\u201d has been pushed down our throats by design folks. Each new scare, each new \u201cvirus\u201d that is most likely purposely released has warped the minds of the masses into believing that the virus or the germ is the issue. Remember the quote by Louis Pasteur \u201cthe microbe is nothing, the terrain is everything\u201d... it\u2019s nothing but huge scare people. And it\u2019s all based on a lie and that lie is that viruses or germs cause disease. No folks. They don\u2019t... it\u2019s your ability (or lack of in this instance) to remove cellular waste. The notion of a virus would very much be inexistent if we all had proper functioning organs and glands, and if our kitchen was feeding and our bathroom was emptying properly.\n\nStart innerstanding health people. Start looking at the cause... but your trusted experts won\u2019t have the answer. They rarely do. Thats not to all experts don\u2019t know... but for the most part yes.\n\u2014\u2014\nFollow my personal \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd @itsazeem\n\u2014\n#covid19 #staywoke #nwo #virus #newworldorder #china #wuhan #pinealgland #wakeuppeople #truthseeker #thirdeye #wakeupsheeple #anonymous  #conscious #secretsocieties #mindcontrol #consciousawareness #politics #selfaware #freedomthinker #illuminati #truthseeker #conscious",
