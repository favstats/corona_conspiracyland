What kind of drug was the judge smoking? \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f Now that he has just been released Jenna has released her full story to Magazines like Fabulous in the hopes noone will ever have to go through what she did with him.\n\nI am posting this because man like this don\u2019t ever deserve to have another woman in their life ever again, how can you do this to the mother of your child.
