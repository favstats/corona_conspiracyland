    "description": "Repost from @theorgonizedearth\n\u2022\nAttorney Leigh Dundas reports that the COVID-19 fatality rate for children in the US is so low that the CDC calculates it at 0.0% for anyone under 19 years of age. \n\nA worldwide study found that COVID-19 has never been passed by children to adults. According to another study, transmission of the \u201cdisease\u201d from people who are unaware they have it is non-existent. \n\nTherefore, social distancing at schools is not justified. \n\nIsolation creates depression, lack of sleep, poor cardiovascular function, cognitive decline, and impaired immunity. \n\nIt also weakens that part of the brain that controls learning. \n\nThe CIA found that isolation was the ideal way to break down a prisoner and that it had a psychological effect similar to being beaten or starved. \n\nThis is a must-watch.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#mandatoryvaccinations #fight5G #eugenics #orderoutofchaos #chaosbydesign #contacttracing #coronavirus #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #transhumanistagenda #artificialintelligence #covid1984  #problemreactionsolution #scamdemic #conspiracyreality #covidiots #5G #geoengineering #climatechangehoax #wtc7 #soros #billgates #rothschild #rockefeller #depopulation #technocracy #kill5G #electromagneticwaronhumanity",
