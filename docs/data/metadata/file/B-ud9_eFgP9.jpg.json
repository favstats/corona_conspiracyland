    "description": "SIGNS OF THE TIMES:\nFox News host Tucker Carlson has criticized World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) top emergency expert for suggesting to authorities that they find those who may have the coronavirus in family homes and \u201cremove them.\u201d Carlson\u00a0brought attention last night\u00a0to a statement by Mike Ryan, WHO\u2019s executive director of emergencies program. Ryan declared that in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, officials may have to enter homes and remove family members. He played a clip of a WHO official saying the contagion has been \u201ctaken off the streets and pushed back into family units.\u201d \u201cNow we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner,\u201d Ryan said\u00a0March 22. \nCarlson found this \u201cthreat\u201d ominous. \u201cJust so you know, we\u2019re coming to your house, seizing your children and \u2018isolating them in a safe and dignified manner,\u2019 whatever that means,\u201d he translated.\nThe Fox host observed that this is not the kind of statement that officials \u201dcasually drop\u201d during press briefings, and normally such \u201cthreats\u201d to take away children might normally \u201ctrigger violence.\u201d However, the media treated Ryan\u2019s declaration as if it were \u201cno big deal.\u201d \u201c(Ryan\u2019s) threat didn\u2019t make headlines in any of the major newspapers in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of moment we\u2019re in.\u201d #JesusIsComing #SignsOfTheTimes #PredictiveProgramming #Heath #Tukkit #Future #OneWorldGovernment #MartialLaw #NewYork #Praise #Virus #NYC #FalseFlag #Truth #WakeUp #OpenYourEyes #StayHome #Quarantine #COVid_19 #NewWorldOrder #MarkOfTheBeast #Awakening #Worship #WakeUp #EndTimes #WorldHealthOrganization #Prepare #Church",
