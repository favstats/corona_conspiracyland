Unfortunately, I suspect that all the summer festivals will be cancelled this year. \ud83d\ude14 Okay, just hoping, but the worldwide situation is too crazy.... \ud83d\ude44\n.\nI'm just listening to my favorite music the whole day, buying new CDs and hoping that there will come better times for all of us. Maybe a new beginning? New chances? Wish you all the best my friends. \u2764\n.\n.\n.\n#fucknwo #corona #covid19 #newworldorder #musiclover #metalgirl #hardcoremusic #festivalseason #concertlover #inkedgirlsofig #rockmusic #moshpit #headbanger #summerdreams #graspopmetalmeeting #enjoyinglife #hope #stayhealthy #healthylifestyle #musicismylove #musicisthebestmedicine #happylife #summerfeeling",
