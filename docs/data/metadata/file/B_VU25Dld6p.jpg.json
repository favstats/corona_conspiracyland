Located in Fairfield County -- adjacent to New York City -- Westport was the first town in the state to report several coronavirus infections, according to a Wednesday\u00a0press release\u00a0from Draganfly.\nThe drones include specialized sensor and computer vision systems that can display a person's temperature, heart and respiratory rates, as well as detect people sneezing or coughing in a crowd, the release said. The technology can accurately detect infectious conditions from 190 feet away, as well as measure social distancing efforts, according to Draganfly. \nThe drones don't use facial recognition technology, and won't be used at people's private residences, according to\u00a0a release\u00a0from the Westport Police Department. Rather, they're used to identify patterns within the population, allowing officials to better track the spread and make decisions about public places while keeping first responders safe, the department said.\n#JesusIsComing #SignsOfTheTimes #Obama #Health #Tukkit #Future #Antichrist #MartialLaw #SocialDistance #CashlessSociety #Connecticut #ConspiracyTheory #FalseFlag #Truth #WakeUp #OpenYourEyes #Drone #Quarantine #COVid_19 #NewWorldOrder #MarkOfTheBeast #Awakening #Trump #WakeUp #EndTimes #PoliceState #Prepare #Technology",
