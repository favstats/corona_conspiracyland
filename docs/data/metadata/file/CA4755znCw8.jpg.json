    "description": "Yesterday we received a call about a confirmed case of COVID19 in my neighbourhood awaiting evacuation by NCDC since the night before.\n\nWhen the matter was announced to the entire community, it was weird that all the people who had been spreading propaganda about the novel #coronavirus being a #scamdemic or #plandemic, they all went silent as mice.\n\nNone of them offered to come out in their singlet and shorts to meet the patient of this disease they claimed was fake, or volunteer their vehicles to take him to the nearest isolation centre.\n\nJust one person showed up, and he was the one who had been warning that the disease was real, and closing in. He was prepared, offered assistance, assessed the environment, and confirmed that the patient had indeed received test results from the #NCDC. \n4 hours later, the patient was evacuated, and immediately this was announced, the #covidiots went about their business of lying that #COVID19 is not real. I had to challenge them as to why they didn't come out to hug and kiss the patient, or at least offer direct help, and they came up with their usual stupid excuses.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that Coronavirus is all over #Lagos, #Abuja, and #Kano. If you like protect yourself, if you like don't. Who will die, will die.",
