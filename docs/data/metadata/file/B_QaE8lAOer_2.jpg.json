    "description": "Vaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feed his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft\u2019s ambition to control a\u00a0global vaccination ID enterprise) and give him dictatorial control of global health policy.\nGates\u2019 obsession with vaccines seems to be fueled by a conviction to save the world with technology.\nPromising\u00a0his share of $450 million\u00a0of $1.2 billion to eradicate Polio, Gates took control of India\u2019s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) which mandated up to\u00a050 doses\u00a0(Table 1) of polio vaccines through\u00a0overlapping immunization programs\u00a0to children before the age of five. Indian doctors blame the Gates campaign for a devastating\u00a0non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) epidemic that paralyzed 490,000\u00a0children beyond expected rates between 2000 and 2017. In 2017, the Indian government dialed back Gates\u2019 vaccine regimen and\u00a0asked Gates\u00a0and his vaccine policies to leave India. NPAFP rates dropped precipitously.\n\u00a02017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reluctantly admitted that the global explosion in polio is\u00a0predominantly vaccine strain. The most frightening epidemics in\u00a0Congo, Afghanistan, and the\u00a0Philippines,\u00a0are all linked to vaccines. In fact, by 2018,\u00a070% of global polio cases\u00a0were vaccine strain.\nIn 2014, the Gates Foundation funded tests of experimental HPV vaccines, developed by Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) and Merck, on\u00a023,000 young girls\u00a0in remote Indian provinces. Approximately\u00a01,200 suffered severe side effects, including autoimmune and fertility disorders.\u00a0Seven died. Indian government investigations charged that Gates-funded researchers committed\u00a0pervasive ethical violations: pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls. The case is now in the country\u2019s Supreme Court.\n.\n.\n#dontbelievethelies #dontbelievethehype #bigthingshappening #backroundnoise #deepstate #hospital #filmyourhospital #clintons #distraction #hoax #corona #virus #coronavirus #hystaria #media #manipulation #panic #wwg1wga #anon #q #unreal #lies #msm #mainstreammedia #news #investigativejournalism #truth #billgates #vaccine #robertkennedy",
