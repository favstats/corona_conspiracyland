    "description": "I miss these days so much...\n.\n.\nThis was one of those \"\"hey, let's go for a ride\"\" rides where you just hopped on your 85 250R and had your buddy hop on your 86 350X and you just hit the trails and take in the fall scenery... .\n.\nBefore careers and kids and life and other layers of responsibility took precedence over your free time.  Those were good days. .\n.\nThis is my buddy Eric on my 350X who, back when we were 14 riding double on my 84 Big Red around, told me how I needed to buy a 250R because they were the fastest and best trike to have.  He's one of my best friends. .\n.\nAnyway, this was one of many great rides that we had, and hopefully there will be more to come soon.  Especially after the whole coronavirus debacle is cleared up and Trump cleans up the swamp and deep state operatives. .\n.\nLooking forward to that.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#hondahoarders #trikelife #atc #250R #atc250R #twostroke #braaplife #braap #braapbraap #mixinggasandhaulingass #350X #atc350x #honda #hondaatc #allterraincycle #backintheday #ridingwithfriends #trump2020 #deepstate #coronavirus #adirondacks #billgatesisevil #pizzagateisreal #ilikethreewheelers #addictedtotrikes #gottacatchemall #getwoke",
