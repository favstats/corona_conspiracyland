    "description": "The coronavirus outbreak could have started as early as mid-September, and the Chinese city of Wuhan may not be where it began, a scientist looking at the origins of the disease has said.\n\nGeneticist Peter Forster, from the U.K.'s University of Cambridge, is leading a research project to understand the historical processes that led to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, they hope to identify the first person who got the virus and served as the source for the initial outbreak. By analyzing networks, they have so far been able to chart the spread of the virus, including the genetic mutations, as it moved from China to Australia, Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/coronavirus-outbreak-september-not-wuhan-1498566.  #wedonotconsent #covid19 #coronavirus #endthelockdown #freedom #nomandates #informedconsent #independentscience #notobillgates #stopid2020 #vaccineinjuryadvocate #reopencanada #saynotobillgates #willnotstaysilent #nonewnormal",
