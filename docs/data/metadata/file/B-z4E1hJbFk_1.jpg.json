Sometimes people\u2018s ability to think for themselves is paralyzed if they\u2019re frightened enough.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to win this battle by kicking the can down the road [prolonging the inevitable]. At some level, we\u2019re going to win this battle by having enough people immune to it, by getting disease ... and it\u2019s a mild disease in 90% of the people. So the idea of minimizing this wave of the pandemic so the next wave in the fall of the year will be greater, that doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense either.\u201d \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#mandatoryvaccinations #fight5G #orderoutofchaos #chaosbydesign #coronavirus #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #martiallaw #covid19 #plandemic #problemreactionsolution #conspiracyreality #facialrecognition \n#geoengineering #5G \n#climatechangehoax #wtc7 \n#soros #billgates #rothschild #zionists #rockefeller #depopulation #eugenics #technocracy #smartcities #electromagneticwaronhumanity",
