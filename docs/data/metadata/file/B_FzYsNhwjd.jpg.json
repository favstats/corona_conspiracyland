    "description": "You know those people who take pride in staying home to save lives, those who claim to be doing their part to contribute for a good cause? Well, it is of my opinion that these people need to find a greater purpose in their lives outside of simply staying home and blindly following executive orders carried out by dictatorial tyrants who oppress and enslave their own citizens. Might be a good idea to find other ways to contribute. Perhaps standing up for your inalienable rights might be one? Or becoming an avid researcher outside of MSM news outlets could be another? I'd say the best one of all would be to grow a backbone and be courageous enough to speak the truth unapologetically, but I digress, thank you so much to everyone who stayed home, without you're noble and courageous efforts, we'd surely all be dead right about now. God bless you all.\nJust kidding by the way. Staying home does absolutely nothing. There is no data available to suggest such nonsense. If anything it only prolongs herd immunity but if you're so worried about dying from some invisible invader then how about YOU stay home? How about YOU wear a mask? How about YOU wear gloves? And leave the rest of us folks with common sense the fuck alone so we can live our lives and support our families in peace you neo-com nazis!\n#stayhome #stayaway \n#socialdistancing #physicaldistancing #Covid19 #coronavirus #plandemic #scamdemic #coronahoax #biggestbullshitinhistory",
