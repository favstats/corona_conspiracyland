It is extremely important.\"\"\n\nMore should be done to help schools take learning online to ensure kids get their educations, he said.\n\nThe 64-year-old tech boss now spends most of his times working with the Global Health division of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHe had been warning of the threat posed to humanity by pandemics since 2015 before the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nDuring the interview, Gates was also heavily critical of the Trump administration - with the US having the highest death and case count in the world with 146,192 and 4.1million.\n\n\ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#VaccineAgenda #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #Event201 #CoViD1984",
