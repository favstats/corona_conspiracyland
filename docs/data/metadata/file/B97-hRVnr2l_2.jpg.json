    "description": "The world as we know it will change forever in the wake of the #coronavirus pandemic, according to #BillGates who declared that we will soon have \u201c#digitalcertificates\u201d to display our health and vaccination status.\nResponding to a question during a Reddit \u201c#AskMeAnything\u201d session, Bill Gates pointed to major changes for ordinary people that could have privacy and #civilrights implications. \u201cEventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it,\u201d said Gates.\nGates also called for a \u201cnational tracking system\u201d, saying that \u201cin #Seattle, the [#UniversityofWashington] is providing thousands of tests per day but no one is connected to a national tracking system\u201d and that \u201cWhenever there is a positive test it should be seen to understand where the disease is and whether we need to strengthen the social distancing.\u201c What is a \u2018digital certificate\u2019? Gates clearly believes the public will accept being branded with digital certificates as easily as they accepted barcodes on consumer items.\nAccording to #IMB, a digital certificate is an electronic document that is used to identify an individual, a server, a company, or some other entity, and to associate that identity with a public key.\nLike a driver\u2019s license, a passport, a student ID, a library card, or other commonly used personal IDs, a certificate provides generally recognized proof of a person\u2019s identity \u2014 or in this case, a person\u2019s health and vaccination status.\nAll of which raises serious questions. What will happen to people who do not trust Bill Gates enough to accept a digital certificate? What will happen to those who refuse to be vaccinated?\nWhile Gates has not elaborated on what his plan entails, or whether a digital certificate will be implanted in the human body, many people are concerned that the certificate could represent the \u201c#markofthebeast\u201d warned about in the Bible.\nBranding human cattle. \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#NewWorldOrder #Technocracy #ScientificDictatorship #VaccineAgenda #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #PopulationControl #Agenda21 #Agenda2030",
