    "description": "Thoughts?\nA little more than one week ago, the mainstream press branded the notion that #nCoV might have originated as a #bioweapon developed in a secretive #Wuhan lab as a deranged #conspiracytheory, with zero conclusive evidence to support it.\nReaders may remember how BuzzFeed was extremely triggered by our coverage.\nAnd they also might be interested to hear that over the last two days, two mainstream financial media organizations and a prominent Republican Senator have all raised questions about the virus\u2019s provenance, suggesting that the bioweapons theory isn\u2019t so far-fetched after all.\nIs it merely a coincidence that the Canadian scientist at the center of a bio-espionage probe was recently found dead in #Africa, as we reported last week? Or that a doctor who helped draft a critical international bioweapons convention has said that the virus might be tied to \u201c#biologicalwarfare?\u201d Or an Israeli bioweapons expert?\nApparently, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton believes #Beijing needs to address these questions, particularly after China\u2019s ambassador to the US Cui Tiankai accused him of \u201cxenophobia\u201d against Chinese people by even suggesting that the virus could have been engineered as a bioweapon. \u201cI think it\u2019s true that a lot is still unknown and our scientists, Chinese scientists, #American scientists, scientists of other countries, are doing their best to learn more about the virus, but it\u2019s very harmful, it\u2019s very dangerous, to stir up suspicion, rumors and spread them among the people,\u201d he said. \u201cFor one thing, this will create panic,\u201d Cui said, adding that it could also foment xenophobia and racist discrimination. \u201cThere are all kinds of speculation and rumors,\u201d he added, noting that there were also conspiracy theories about the virus originating in the #UnitedStates. \u201cHow can we believe all these crazy things?\u201d On another note, when asked about Chen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who disappeared after covering the outbreak in Wuhan, Cui responded \u201cI have never heard of this guy, so I don\u2019t have any information to share with you.\u201d #Event201 #Coronavirus",
