    "description": "Doctors held a White Coat Summit on the steps of the Supreme Court in Washington DC to expose the reality of the virus. They touted several well-known and long-studied treatments that are proven to treat the virus including hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and azithromyocin aka Zithromax. No mainstream media outlets covered the summit at all. Breitbart News was the most prominent news source on the scene.\nThe full conference outside of the Supreme Court was about 45 minutes in length. A variety of doctors from all around the United States stepped up to the outdoor podium to give their testimony on the effectiveness of virus treatments shunned by mainstream media and big pharma.\nThese doctors\u2019 testimony is extremely important because they\u2019ve had success with virus patients. It makes more sense to listen to a successful doctor than an unsuccessful one, or a person that has a doctorate but does not treat patients, like Anthony Fauci.\n#Zithromax #Zinc #Hydroxychloroquine #FireFauci #AnthonyFauci #BillGates #GatesFoundation #vaccines #CoronaVirus #Covid19 #DonaldTrump #CNN #BBC #FoxNews #MSNBC #ABC #CBS #NBC #WHO #CDC #Masks #MasksOffAmerica",
