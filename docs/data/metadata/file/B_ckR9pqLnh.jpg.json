    "description": "I have changed so much since the pandemic started \ud83d\ude4f\n.\nI appreciate nature, freedom, health and simple joys of life so much more than before. .\nI have realized that we don't really need so much to be happy. In fact, not much at all. .\nI don't see a necessity to hold on to something that doesn't give me joy and serves me anymore. I see no more need to stress and hustle like there is no tomorrow.\n.\nBecause every single day that is given to us is a gift. It's magic. All we have to do is follow the joy with no resistance. I am choosing to live an easy, less stressful and simple life.\n.\nPerhaps start growing my own food. Being as close as I can to nature and engage in meaningful connections with like-minded people \u2764\ufe0f\n.\nHave you noticed changes in you as well?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid_19 #weareinthistogether #smallbizz #girlbosslife #fempreneur #sheboss #smallbusinessmarketing #smallbizowner #womenwithvision #womeninbiz #natureheals #bevisibleonline #virtualassistant #virtualbusiness #soulfulbusiness #transformation #smallbusinesstips #businesscoaching #spiritualentrepreneur #womenwithaplan #choselove #saynotobillgates",
