Can\u2019t let this ride. All hands on deck. Rest Easy Twin.  #3rd #MinnesotaRacistAssCops \nI ain\u2019t going back and forward with no body. Judges give the death penalty to people who take lives right. Why cops who take lives don\u2019t get the death penalty. I guess it\u2019s cool to play God only when it\u2019s  benefiting this crooked system. U kill us for nothing u need to die too. Let your family feel the pain u caused with your hate. Rest Easy Twin I promise I ain\u2019t letting this ride. The truth they don\u2019t wanna hear.\nWhile the world only has to deal with the CORONAVIRUS. Black people still have to deal with #Racism and #PoliceBrutality. Smh The attack on our people never stops. \n#GeorgeFloyd\n#AhmaudArbery\n#SeanReed\n#BreonaTaylor \n#POPULATIONCONTROL \n#corona  #coronavirus  #Hr6666 #TraceAct #COVID19 #Shutdown #Martiallaw #quarantine  #pandemic #5G #Vaccination\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"\"fair use\"\" for purposes such as criticism. commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
