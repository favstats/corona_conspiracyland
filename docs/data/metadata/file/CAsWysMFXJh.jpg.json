If you realize that Twitter started labeling the tweets from the PRESIDENT of the USA as misleading...then you have to ask yourself a couple of things. First of all who gave twitter the authority of the truth? Second why would they do that? Third who will benefit from this the most? Fourth do I believe in democracy? Fifth where the hell is our freedom of speech then? I don\u2019t really care if you\u2019re left or right .... I care if you\u2019re for humanity. Although you might think well what do I have to lose or it doesn\u2019t impact me ... then ask yourself the question ... if even the most powerful person in the USA get\u2019s silenced... what does that mean for me?  Does my voice matter? My rights? My freedom? My future? Don\u2019t you wonder what the real purpose is of all the social media channels we have? Think about that... before it\u2019s too late...and the West turns into China \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063 \u2063\n\u2063 \u2063 \u2063 \u2063 \u2063\n\n#speakup #truthseeker #draintheswamp  #pizzagate #nonewnormal #q #truthfreedomhealth #billgates #5g #freedom #londonrealarmy #cabal #who #wwg1wga #id2020 #standthefuckup  #covid19 #rebelonaroll \u2063",
