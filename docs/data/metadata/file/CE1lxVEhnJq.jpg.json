AntiFa and BLM protests have been the only alternative talking point since the release of CoViD and I think many are growing tired of such exposure. All the while, people\u2019s lives are being deliberately destroyed by malfeasance and planned obsolescence with political parties catering to droves of dumbing down people.\n\nFrom my approximation, life won\u2019t be getting any easier for any of us, any time soon. All year we have tried to raise the alarm about the alarming amount of societal and economic changes taking place in such a short amount of time, and on que, they\u2019re beginning to surface; mass unemployment, inflation, food insecurity and more are now common. Our once great country has been crippled by the coronavirus and our response to it.\n\nSo, with a fair amount of the population being disproportionately affected by this virus, and seemingly incompetent politicians on both sides continuing to bungle their responses, I think the real question we should be asking is, \u201cHave we had enough?\u201d If we continue to let our lives be micromanaged by tyrants extracting our wealth and resources from us, do we have the right to complain? Sad truth is, we\u2019re reaching a point where both action and inaction will yield the same result.\n\n#FactionsOfFreedom #FreedomFaction #Agenda21 #Agenda2030 #Agenda2050 #CoViD19 #CoViD1984 #Technocracy #NewWorldOrder #Coronavirus #SocioEconomicReformation #Technofascism #CivilUnrest #Destabilization #Zbellion #MartialLaw #MedicalFreedom #VaccineAgenda #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda",
