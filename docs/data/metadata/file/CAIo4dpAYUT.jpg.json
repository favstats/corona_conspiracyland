    "description": "Poor lady. I feel so bad for her. She is not the only one whose life work has been destroyed. My own mothers 20 year business is deeply affected by this plandemic. We lost SO MUCH business and if a \"\"second\"\" wave hits, I'm afraid we may have to permanently shutdown. \ud83d\ude2d Our livelihoods and dignity is being robbed from us and no one seems to care. Take a look at Cuomo's Instagram account. Practically everyday I have a debate with his fans that praise him like he is Jesus Christ himself. His mismanagement of this whole situation and the fact that so many NYers are willing to give up their life for something they don't know the TRUE facts about, is deeply sad and I am very much looking forward to moving out of this place and somewhere rural where my only friends will be birds and trees. \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude14\n#covidiots #covidhoax #conspiracies #nyc #reopenamerica #conspiracytheory #fearmongering #reopenusa #reopennyc #truth #facts #plandemic #agenda21 #scamdemic #antivax #filmyourhospital #fakenews \n#lockdown #medialies #endlockdown #government #spiritualwarfare\u00a0 #governmentlies #woke #constitution #humanrights \n#wakeup #sheeple #humanrights #unity",
