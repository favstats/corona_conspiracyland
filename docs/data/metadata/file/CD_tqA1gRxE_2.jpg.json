The \u201cReal\u201d World is so Messed Up - Literally in my Face. \ud83d\ude37Just going to get Groceries is infuriating. People wearing useless, dirty masks, handling items with filthy gloves, looking for arrows adhered to floor tiles - to tell them where to stand, which way to turn. Paranoid zombies feeding daily MSM sludge. They actually still believe that Shit? SMH.\n\nKinda tired of the mass willful ignorance, the smug virtue signalling, the insane double speak etc. (\u201cSocial\u201d Distancing - WTF?) \n\nBut how the Hell does one unplug from this \u201cNew Normal\u201d...? Just isolate and pretend our Rights and Freedoms aren\u2019t being messed with? Ignore the blatant Censorship of valid arguments that support and encourage a more Independent and Healthy population? Act like nothing\u2019s Wrong with this whole situation? \n\nJust - Praying I don\u2019t go Postal. .\n.\n\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\udd2b.\n#breathefree #freespeech #timetogetreal #honest #tellthetruth #nonconformist #donotconform #idonotconsent #iwillnotcomply \n#plandemic2020 #sickofthebullshit #quarantinethesicknotthehealthy #fuckmasks #riotsarentprotests #lootingisntjustice #fuckblm #fuckantifa #fuckcovid19 #goingpostal #peoplearestupid #dontbeasheep #theworldisfucked #thetruthwillsetyoufree #nomaske",
