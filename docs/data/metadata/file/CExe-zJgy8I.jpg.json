My intuition just told me that I need to go home to Germany to see my mum & friends as long as it\u2019s still possible. And I understand that, if I book a flight I agree to the companies terms & conditions, which includes wearing masks these days. I\u2018m totally willing to pay that price in order to hug my loved ones.\nStill I\u2019m a rebel by heart, so here\u2018s my compromise.\nDo what you can with what you have where you\u2019re at \ud83d\ude09\n.\n.\n#nomask #newwokeorder #wakeup #thegreatawakening #arrestbillgates #stopsoros #stop5g #event201 #agenda2030 #pizzagate #pedogate #widerstand2020 #nichtohneuns #fuckthesystem #coronauntersuchungsausschuss #rebel #covid1984 #covidhoax2020",
