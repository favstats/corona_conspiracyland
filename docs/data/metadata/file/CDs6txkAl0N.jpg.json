    "description": "Who Is Running the WHO?\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, both Bill Gates and the World Health Organization have stepped onto the center stage as the world looks to them for answers. By now, it is common knowledge that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the number one non-state donor to the WHO. The #UnitedStates has been the top state donor but that may change under the #Trumpadministration. Gates was also the first non-state individual to give a keynote address to the #WHO general assembly.\n\nAccording to a\u00a0report by\u00a0Politico, Bill Gates\u2019 opinion (and money) has so much influence on the WHO that officials privately call it \u201cthe Bill Chill.\u201d Sixteen officials speaking on the condition of anonymity told Politico that Gates has an out-sized influence on the politics of the WHO and few dare challenge him.\u00a0\u201cHe is treated liked a head of state, not only at the WHO, but also at the G20,\u201d a #Geneva-based NGO representative stated.\n\nThe accusations of Gates\u2019 influence were seconded by Foreign Affairs when they\u00a0reported\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cfew policy initiatives or normative standards set by the World Health Organization are announced before they have been casually, unofficially vetted by Gates Foundation staff.\u201d\n\nThe WHO\u2019s current Director General is Tedros Adhanom, a former Health Minister of Ethiopia. During his tenure as Minister of Health of #Ethiopia, Tedros collaborated with the Clinton Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to\u00a0work on vaccines, among other health measures. Politico reported that prior to Tedros being selected for the WHO position in 2017 Gates was accused of supporting Tedros and using his influence to help win the nomination.\n\nWhile most of the member country delegates expressed their belief that Gates is well intentioned, some feared that the Gates Foundation\u2019s money comes from \u201cbig business\u201d and could\u00a0\u201cserve as a Trojan horse for corporate interests to undermine WHO\u2019s role in setting standards and shaping health policies\n\n\ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffe more in comments!\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe\n#masks #CoViD1984\n#pandemic #nwo #eugenics #depopulation #wakeup\n#Maskprotests #technocracy #cashlesssociety #event201",
