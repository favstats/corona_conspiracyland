Predictably, people now are starving. Why is no one listening to these voices? Why are we allowing a virologist and a billionaire to dictate Global economic policies that could starve a billion people? Why are the networks censoring dissent or dismissing it as the ravings of conspiracy theorists,die hard confederates or anti-science Trumpers? Why is there no effort at risk assessment? Why are there no economists on CNN? \ud83d\udd3b\ud83d\udd3b\ud83d\udd3b\n#stopbillgates #pandemic #covid19",
