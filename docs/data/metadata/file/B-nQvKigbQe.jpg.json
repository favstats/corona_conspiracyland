It is literally 1000% impossible to transfer a virus from one person to another without an injection directly into your bloodstream through a shot or vaccine. Viruses are NOT living things.  The only place airborne viruses exist is in the movies -Fact. You are being lied to on such a massive scale that you be should be outraged! .\n.\nWearing a mask and Social Distancing does absolutely nothing for the spread of any virus and those in power are mocking you by insisting otherwise and having you self-humuliate yourself in public. They are counting on you being too gullibly ignorant, submissive and afraid to actually research what a virus really is for yourself. \nBelow is a very short list of health experts you can search for across all platforms that will explain very clearly what viruses are and how they are not in anyway contagious so you can stop living in mindless fear. You'll also find many of their clips on this channel. Start with YouTube and bitchute.\n.\n. ( Please add names of any others and lets get a large list going) .\n\nDr. Shiva Ayyadurai\nDr. John Bergman\nTom Barnett\nDr. Stefan Lanka\nDr. Andrew Kaufman\nDr. Sebi\nJames True\nAntoine B\u00e9champ \nSpacebusters - (bitchute only)\nDr. Robert Morse .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#virusesareNOTcontagious #yourbeingliedto #wakeup\n#unbearables #notmyvirus #wakeup  #SocialDistancing #filmyourhospital #fearisthevirus #fearmongering #feartactics #masshysteria  #coronavirus #corona #covid #plandemic #unbearables \n#coronavirusoutbreak #trueearther\n#pandemic2020 #coronaviruspandemic\n#coronavirus #covid  #covid19italia #coronavirusoutbreak #hoax #wearethenewsnow #citizenjournalist",
