Oh but its black people who make it all about race right???? @williedlive\n---\nI want you to think about the language the reporter #CourtneyFischer chose to use \u201cBlack officer killed Black man.\u201d When is the first or last time you ever heard a US reporter say \u201cThe White officer killed the White man,\u201d I\u2019ll answer that,  NEVER! This is why people don\u2019t trust the media. They use certain key words and phrases to push certain narratives to match their agendas. They are not for the people. Could it be that the mainstream media, law non-enforcement, the courts and the government are all in the same gang? Is that why it\u2019s so hard for everyday people to get justice or be treated fairly? Too many people are being slaughtered in the name of law and order by those in law who are out of order. We can longer allow those hired to do the bidding of evil empires to operate with impunity. They must be called out - every single time. Courtney we see you. \ud83d\udc40@courtneyabc13 #irunwithahmaud #IRunWithMaud\n#AhmaudArbery #Joggingwhileblack\n#SeanReed\n#BreonaTaylor \nWhile the world only has to deal with the CORONAVIRUS.
