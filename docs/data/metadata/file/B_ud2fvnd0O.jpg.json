    "description": "Posted @withregram \u2022 @kgb_giddey I will not wear a mask, bandana, or face covering to keep your irrational fears at bay. Cloth face masks are not recommended by the CDC. The cloth mask will still allow viruses and bacteria to pass through. In addition, I like clean air -- I won't breath in my own CO2 to develop hypercapnia for you. \nKeys to wellness:\n1) Go out in the sun\n2) Stop eating processed foods\n3) Avoid sugar\n4) Drink water\n5) Up your vitamin C intake\n6) Eat your vegetables\n\nIf you aren't doing these things, but wearing a mask and disposable gloves, then you are doing it wrong. \n#sorrynotsorry #learntherisks #NoNewNormal #NoMore #covid_19 #BillGatesofHell #saynotobillgates #eo2020_70",
