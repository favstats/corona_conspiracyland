The man is said to have expressed a belief that the incident was part of a government plot against him.\n\nOfficials said, however, that the purchase was denied owing to the man being on probation for a prior drink-driving conviction, which prohibits firearm sales until 2025.\n\nPolice said that the man began ranting about needing to arm himself against Bill Gates, saying that \u201cpeople are going to try and get me and I need to defend myself\u201d. City Attorney Mara W Elliott commuted that \u201cThanks to public vigilance, police were able to safely intervene and remove firearms from someone who presented a danger to himself and others before he resorted to violence.\u201d #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #ID2020 #Technocracy #ScientificDictatorship\n-\n-\n--\n#Conscious_gawd\n\u25cf@Conscious_gawd\n#Conscious_god\n\u25cf@Spread_Da_Truth\n#Spread_Da_Truth\n\u25cf@Conscious_Diversity\n#Conscious_Diversity\n\u2606Twitter:#JAHLogix\u2606 - #regrann",
