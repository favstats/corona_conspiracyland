Do some research, you\u2019ll be awakened to the real plan.\n\nDoes anybody think anymore???\n\nIt\u2019s right in front of our faces. If you dummies would at a minimum just read the box that these \u201cuseless\u201d masks are sold in, you would instantly awake to the outright scam being perpetrated on the people of this world. We must start fighting back against these animals who are trying their best to destroy humanity.\n\nWAKE UP \ud83d\udc11\n\nSTOP THIS MADNESS!\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\n#masks #mindcontrol  #wakeup #fauci #firefauci #vaccines #arrestfauci #arrestbillgates #humanity #masksdontwork #antimask #covid #scam #openamerica #usa #sheep #health #medical #facts #fakenews #trump2020 #kag #backtoschool #backtowork #backtolife #firefauci #",
