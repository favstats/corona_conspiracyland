    "description": "Its weird....instead of the spark of excitement I usually get from connecting dots....this one really makes this real. Look at the nurse\u2019s face in slide 2 & 3 - that\u2019s the face of a nurse comforting a CHILD. I can\u2019t imagine someone with Covid-19 being so sick that they need intravenous fat emulsions.... These photos were some of the first to be released by the US Navy twitter of some of USNS Mercy\u2019s first patients being brought on board.\n\nSickening. America find your love and compassion for each other because we\u2019re about need it in floods. .\n.\n.\n.\n.\ncred \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb @save_the_children_qanon #usnsmercy #nyc #wwg1wga #q #qanon #17 #pizzagate #pedogate #pedohunter #savethechildren #qanonarmy #wwg1wgaworldwide #satanicritualabuse #hampsteadcoverup #thegreatawakening #Adrenochrome #pedowood #news #covid19 #biblical",
