In a press conference on Tuesday, he indicated that the state\u2019s government is considering a variety of options to deal with the pandemic. \u201cWe have the ability to do martial law \u2026 if we feel the necessity,\u201d Newsom said. This action would essentially create a temporary military state in which the law would be suspended, and the military would control the population. Fox 5\u00a0reported\u00a0that the governor \u201chas already placed the California National Guard on alert for humanitarian duties, including food distribution and public safety activities.\u201d The governor also gave an update on the status of the state\u2019s schools. He explained that \u201cfew if any,\u201d will reopen before the summer break. Newsom encouraged Californians to stay united, and said that \u201cwe will get back to the life that we have lived.\u201d According to the governor, the state is acquiring two empty hospitals to accommodate sharp increases in the number of patients infect with the virus. They are also working with about 900 hotels to house hospital patients and the homeless, who are particularly vulnerable to catching the illness.\n#JesusIsComing #SignsOfTheTimes #PredictiveProgramming #Heath #Tukkit #Future #Beastmode #MartialLaw #NewYork #CashlessSociety #Virus #ConspiracyTheory #FalseFlag #Truth #WakeUp #OpenYourEyes #Tech #LosAngeles #COVid_19 #NewWorldOrder #MarkOfTheBeast #Awakening #ProblemReactionSolution #WakeUp #EndTimes #BootsOnTheGround #Prepare #California",
