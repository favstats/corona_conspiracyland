When you go down the rabbit \ud83d\udc07 hole \ud83d\udd73 and know what\u2019s really going on in the world it makes it hard. You notice all the symbolism \ud83d\udc41 , the political agendas, replacing real fans (the energy that make the sport) with virtual ones \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f, the masks \ud83c\udfad and this push for we the people to with live this \u201cNew Normal\u201d Hypocrisy! Sports, mainly Football and basketball for me, have been such a big part of my life since I was a kid. Sports taught me so much about life, the commitment, dedication and trials and tribulations so watching now for me is a love/ hate relationship. Through these tough times we need to find outlets and distractions. Having my family (especially the kids) bringing us together every Sunday to watch football for a 20+ year tradition is important to hold onto! \ud83d\udcaf\n=======================\nScreaming all the way to #Philly \ud83e\udd85 to my brotha from anotha motha @briceizyah for surprising me with that new clean off white Cam Newton Jersey on my birthday. \ud83d\udca7\ud83e\udd75\ud83d\udd25 To the moon \ud83c\udf19 and back.
