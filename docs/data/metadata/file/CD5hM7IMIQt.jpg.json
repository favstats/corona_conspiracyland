    "description": "Truth is the test for Covid-19 might show you are positive for having had a cold once.\n\n\"\"A positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold.\"\"\n\nThe test is not designed to detect Covid-19 in particular, but any flu variant in general. Very likely, what has been and is being counted as Covid-19 would have been counted as a cold or the flu in regular years.\n\nBut not in 2020.\n\nPS. Plus the test was never meant to test for viruses, according to the man who invented it (and won a Nobel Prize for doing so).\n\nSource: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html\n\n#covidtestforcolds #covid19test #covidhoax #scamdemic #plandemic #flushot #influenza #flu #coronavirus",
