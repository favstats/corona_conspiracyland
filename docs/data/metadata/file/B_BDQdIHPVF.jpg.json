    "description": "Sweden has been getting a lot of backlash for not taking any precautionary measures against the covid19 pandemic. In fact, up until April life in Sweden has gone on as usual. Swedes can still go to school, they can mingle at parks and outdoors events, they can even drink at bars. It was only a few days ago the government announced that swedish citizens should stay apart rather than lockdown.\n\nID2020 is the alliance of a global partnership to maximize the efforts of a digital ID between all human beings. Also that 5g will be the only technology to handle  the \"\"\"\"future\"\"\"\" of a real time system to connect everything to a world wide database.\n\nInterestingly enough, Sweden is one of the only countries to begin giving a ID microchip implant into the hands of any willing Swedish citizens. Could this have anything to do with Sweden's \"\"\"\"softer\"\"\"\" approach to the coronavirus lockdown? #id2020alliance #agenda21 #covid19 #coronavirus #event201 #billgates #youcantstopthetruth #staywoke #keepinformed #markofthebeast",
