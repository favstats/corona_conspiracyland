Because once you stop participating in the lie that is being told that journey from going within becomes endless and you will have to look deep within yourself and do and lot of forgiving and healing from all of our past traumas and actions. And to many people are so damn scared of doing self work and becoming a better human being that they rather keep a mask on, stay tunnel visioned on anything that doesn\u2019t effect themselves and live in the bubble that their family and friends stay in as well.\n\nI\u2019m tired of the cognitive dissonance from the public. People have been brainwashed literally by the government and corporations. We\u2019ve been fed poison and injected with it as well. And this criminals are walking free because the people got a little stimulus money while the entire economy is on the verge of collapsing and transferring over to a digital currency and while this is happening there is a massive amount of wealth being consolidated.\n\nFollow @perceptionofpositivity \ud83d\udc41\ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25\n\nReposted from @standup911 \n\n-\n\n#billgates ##id2020 #coronavirus #socialdistancing #healthcare #covid19 #plandemic #indoctrination #mindfulness #wellness #perspective #perception #pineal #pinealgland #higherself #higherthinking #higherawakening #higherconsciousness #cbd #cbdoil #cannabis #cannabiscommunity #psilocybe #psychonaut #psychology #philosophy",
