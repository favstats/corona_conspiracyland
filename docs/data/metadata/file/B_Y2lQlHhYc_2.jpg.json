    "description": "The lawyer argues that the Legault government\u2019s isolation and containment policies enacted since the public-health emergency was declared March 13 violate rights and were enacted without proper democratic debate.\n\nThe Public Health Act allows for a ten-day emergency period that can be renewed, but requires National Assembly approval for periods when the number of days hits 30.\n\nRacicot argues that there must be a democratic debate by elected officials before depriving citizens of their liberties for long periods of time.\n\nThe lawyer argues that decrees from March, April and May should be annulled. \u201cIt is clear that fundamental rights and freedoms have been violated,\u201d writes Racicot.\n\nThe lawyer also suggests that the government overestimated the impact of COVID-19, and relied on models that were alarmist, and that the government \u201cfabricated the crisis to change society.\u201d https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/mobile/quebec-lawyer-sues-government-for-violating-rights-during-covid-19-crisis-1.4905925\n\n#freedom #nomandates #informedconsent #independentscience #notobillgates #stopid2020 #vaccineinjuryadvocate #reopencanada #saynotobillgates #willnotstaysilent #nonewnormal #truth #covid #vaccinechoicecanada\n#democracyisdead #totalitariangovt #unethicalpoli #norepresentation #sayno #draconianpoli",
