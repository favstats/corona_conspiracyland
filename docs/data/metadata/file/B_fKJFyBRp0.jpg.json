So, go ahead, take the time you need to recuperate because we\u2019re just getting started, and I think that\u2019s the uncomfortable truth we\u2019ve all been wanting to admit. These cycles of crisis only go on for so long and CoViD-19 hasn\u2019t left, and in the recent words of the W.H.O.\u2019s Director-General Tedros, the coronavirus, or at least the response to it, will be with us for quite some time.\n\nWith Bill Gates being exposed on a daily basis for nearly three weeks now and the petition calling for his arrest and investigation having reached over 400,000 signatures, you\u2019d expect some type of action being taken against him, but like many others with a long list of criminal acts against humanity, their justice is being forestalled. It\u2019s in that apprehension that more people are becoming aware of their injustices; so for every inaction, there is always some form of countervailing. That\u2019s how this great game is played, and regardless of its players, the rules remain the same.\n\nThe times we are in couldn\u2019t be more obvious. This is why the prophetic nomenclature has been removed from our modern language, not only so we wouldn\u2019t have a reference to these astounding events, but also so our understanding would be robbed from us. We are moving forward into a time of both sorrow and wonder, from which joy and pain will arise. It is in days like these that people\u2019s hearts either fail them or through sheer grace, they are found.\n\n#FactionsOfFreedom #FreedomFaction #Podcast #Agenda21 #Agenda2030 #Technocracy #NewWorldOrder #ScientificDictatorship #Coronavirus #CoViD19 #1984 #ArrestBillGates #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #Event201 #NewNormal #OperationGridlock #PowerToThePeople #OneWorldTogetherAtHome #WakeUp",
