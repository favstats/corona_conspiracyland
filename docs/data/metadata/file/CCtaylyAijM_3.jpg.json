    "description": "Orlando, Florida\u2019s FOX 35 investigated several COVID-19 testing facilities claiming 100% or nearly 100% of tests they handled, and learned that the facilities were wildly incorrect in their reporting, with actual positive cases being closer to 10% of less.\nAfter noticing several local labs had a near-100% rate of positive tests and questioning the almost impossible odds of this being true, FOX 35 learned that several labs were wildly incorrect in their reporting.\nThe report showed that Orlando Health had a 98 percent positivity rate. However, when FOX 35 News contacted the hospital, they confirmed errors in the report. Orlando Health\u2019s positivity rate is only 9.4 percent, not 98 percent as in the report.\nThe report also showed that the Orlando Veteran\u2019s Medical Center had a positivity rate of 76 percent. A spokesperson for the VA told FOX 35 News on Tuesday that this does not reflect their numbers and that the positivity rate for the center is actually 6 percent.\nThis was not just a mistake . This is fraud to go from 100% positivity rate to 9.4% where is the outrage .\n Continue to speak out people . Continue to defy their orders , take off the muzzles . \nN95 masks do not regulate air going out only going in . 0 protection . \n\nPaper masks are not effective at all against the coronvirus becuase the virus goes right through the mask and they were made for sterile environments .\n\nAll other cloth masks , handkerchiefs,  homage masks literally do absolutely nothing . \n\nMasks are a sign of conformity,  how long are you willing to wear the mask ? \n.\n.\n.\n#nomask #masks #school #socialdistancing\u00a0 #deepstate #hospital #filmyourhospital #1984 #distraction #hoax #corona #virus #coronavirus #hystaria #media #manipulation #panic #wwg1wga #anon #q #unreal #lies #msm #mainstreammedia #news #investigativejournalism #truth #freedom #givemelibertyorgivemedeath",
