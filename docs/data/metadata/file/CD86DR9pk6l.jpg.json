    "description": "MM: \u201cTrue or False; Sunlight kills the virus?\u201d\nFauci: \u201cIt does. That\u2019s a truism. It\u2019s one of the reasons why outside, in the sun, when you are interacting, that that is much much better than being inside....That\u2019s why it\u2019s one of the 4 important things we say, outside is always better than inside\u201d\n\nSo why are we told to do the opposite? Inside and isolating. In Victoria it is against the \u201claw\u201d to be outside exercising for more than an hour a day. (I think prisoners get longer) And you *must* be exercising. You can\u2019t just go sit in the sunshine, if you do you can be fined $1652. You can\u2019t go beyond 5klms from home, and you must do it as close to home as possible. We are also not allowed outside after 8pm either. Does it sound like that is really for your health?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#covidscam #plandemic #nwo #scamdemic #plandemic #fakenewsmedia #standupmelbourne #unitedwestand #riseupaustralia",
