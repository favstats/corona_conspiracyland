Without it there\u2019s only mental trauma. Our children\u2019s\u2019 subconscious minds will never forget this and the trauma will be with them for the rest of their lives! All over a \u201cvirus\u201d that\u2019s never been proven to be contagious. No virus has been proven to be contagious, by the way. \n\nThis is what\u2019s needed to prove contagion:\n.\nIn 1937, Thomas M. Rivers modified Koch\u2019s postulates in order to deter\u00admine the infectious nature of viruses.23 Rivers\u2019 postulates stated:\n.\n1.The virus could be isolated from diseased hosts.\n\n2. The virus could be cultivated in host cells.\n\n3.The virus could be filtered from a medium that also contained bacteria (proof of filter\u00adability).\n\n4.The filtered virus would produce a compa\u00adrable disease when the cultivated virus was used to infect experimental animals.\n\n5.The virus could be re-isolated from the infected experimental animal.\n\n6.A specific immune response to the virus could be detected.\n.\nNote that researchers have never been able to prove that a specific virus causes a spe\u00adcific disease using Rivers\u2019 postulates.\n.\nNone of the studies carried out to date has provided any semblance of proof that we are dealing with a deadly viral disease. The fact that illness appears in clusters may seem to call for \u201ccontagion\u201d as an explanation, but an equally appropriate explanation is not the germ but the terrain. Which environmental factors are affecting many people in the same place at the same time? One obvious candidate is electromagnetic pollution. Hmmm... when was Sonar introduced? When did the \u201cSpanish flu pandemic\u201d hit? What electromagnetic technology is hitting us now?\n.\nOur children deserve better. Please do your part. The system cannot tear us down if we all rise together. \ud83d\ude4c\n.\n.\n\n.#wwg1wga #wwg1wgaworldwide #nonewnormal #q #qanon #covid_19 #qarmy #truth #truthseeker #weareinthistogether #wearethenewsnow #health #wellness #saynotobillgates #arrestbillgates #holisitichealth #healthykids  #keepkidssafe #kidsneedmore #medicalfreedomactivist #freedom",
