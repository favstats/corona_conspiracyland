    "description": "I beg anyone and everyone to RESEARCH. Research everything you can. Seek Truth and Speak Truth. Silence is consent. Do not consent.  Speaking truth is more pertinent than ever. If you can wake up even one person, you could be saving their life. We can not allow the media to divide us. United we stand, divided we fall. Where we go one, we go all. Wake up. Question everything. The world is a stage. Follow the white rabbit. Free your mind. Free yourself. Cut the cord. Unplug. Turn off the TV. Unchain from the media. \nHit \u2764\ufe0f let me know you see me. \nThanks Patriots\n\u270a\ud83c\udffb\u270a\ud83c\udffc\u270a\ud83c\udffd\u270a\ud83c\udffe\u270a\ud83c\udfff #WWG1WGA #QAnon #TheGreatAwakening #SeekTruthSpeakTruth #FollowTheWhiteRabbit #WakeUp #QuestionEverything #Trump #Trump2020 #MAGA #KAG #DemExit #WalkAway #PizzagateIsReal #JusticeForSethRich #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #UnitedWeStandDividedWeFall #WhereWeGoOneWeGoAll #QArmy #DigitalSoldier #Patriot #CitizenJournalist #DarkToLight #SymbolismWillBeTheirDownfall #Shadowbanned #Censorship #Orwells1984 #COVID1984",
