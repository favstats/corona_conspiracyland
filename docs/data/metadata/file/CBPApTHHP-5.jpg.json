    "description": "With all these protests and people suddenly forgetting their fear and forgetting The Covid narrative and guidelines can we resume our lives already? At this point there\u2019s been so much contact across the nation and globally that I think just open and hope for herd immunity if it\u2019s even an issue anymore. I mean are we all going to settle down and go back to quarantine and the extreme social distancing measures at the beginning? Because that\u2019s the only other option. But honestly with all the back-and-forth speculation and changing and new stuff coming to light as far as this virus and the numbers being much lower and definitely not much of any of this being science backed, I want to have the right to live my life. We cannot sanitize life and we cannot live in fear any longer and I\u2019m at the breaking point.\n.\n#covid #convid #endthelockdown #letmework #pandemic #fauci #fraud #deepstate #scamdemic",
