    "description": "\ud83d\udd39I\u2019ve been struggling with this little one. He is 4 years old (just turned 4 in May) and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the age thing, the stress of a move on a child, or the fact that he has a new brother who requires much of our attention. Or maybe it\u2019s all of the above!! But he\u2019s been extra difficult to navigate these days. Has anyone else gone through something similar? I\u2019ve decided to do what I can and LISTEN to him. To STOP and be with him. To PLAY with him. And maybe that\u2019s why he is frustrated. We haven\u2019t had the time for all of that lately... sometimes I forget life isn\u2019t just hard for the adults. He misses his school and friends SOOO MUCH. He asks about school once or TWICE A DAY. My heart hurts for him... He\u2019s only been on this earth 4 years and it feels like a whole year is just being taken from him. Anyways, I love you so much, Nolan. \u2764\ufe0f You\u2019re my baby boy and you always will be. I love being your mommy. \n\n(Swipe for the reality of what it\u2019s like getting a pic with a 4 year old HAHA) \n\n#4yearold #boymom #boymama #sahmmomofboys #parentingishard #navigatingparenthood #babybrother #olderbrother #texasmoms #texasmotherhood #flowerchild #covidparenting #covidsucks #saynotobillgates #saynotonewnormal #parentingintexas #mommylife",
