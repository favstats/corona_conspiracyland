    "description": "If the white man is in control of everything...why would they allow the public to see videos of white cops killing blacks? Why would they allow these cops to go to trial and publically and have the events trend all over national news and social media? If you really think the white man is in CONTROL.. Why do you not think they aren't in CONTROL to how you are received information? And if so, why don't you think that they allow such information to work towards their benefit?\n\nIn this video I express my thoughts on how the American government has been using division between the people in order to program the people into accepting a martial law over the country by using selective \"\"\"\"proofs\"\"\"\" to demonstrate a racial divide that needs solution. (I accidentally said this twice in the video clip. It was repeated twice due to a clip edit error. You can disgard it or watch it twice) \u263a \nDue to the recent race war now happening all over the United States, following the riots here in the city of Los Angeles, many people are posting about George Floyd and police brutality memes and quotes in order to demonstrate what side they are on in the fight against #policebrutality. That fight has now turned into a race war against whites and blacks.\n\nBut is this all on accident?\n\nNo.\n\nI express how and why \"\"\"\"The White Man\"\"\"\" or the government uses racial hate as a tool to love the people in a direction that they want like a Master moves his chess pieces during a game.\n\n#icantbreathe\n#georgefloyd\n#policebrutality\n#Justiceforgeorgefloyd\n#Justiceforfloyd\n#endpolicebrutality\n#riots2020\n#losangelesriots\n#derekchauvin\n#Governmentcorruption\n#Governmentconspiracy\n#martiallaw\n#coronaviruspandemic\n#plandemic2020\n#racewar\n#blm\n#blackoutday2020\n#blackouttuesday\n#nojusticenopeace\n#justiceforahmaud\n#ahmuad\n#breonnataylor\n#stopracism\n#WakeUpAmerica\n#wakeup\n#martialiscoming\n#martiallaw",
