    "description": "The elderly man being mentioned here in the UK had only been took to hospital 10 minutes previous.  however this company had confirmation 2 hours previous that the man was actually dead! and I assume already been to his property and also told to make neighbors aware of his death. hate to think what has happened to the poor bloke but I can guess he won't be coming back.  killing people off for numbers. next thing someone will be involved in an accident and they'll pin the death to the \"\"virus\"\". how many people can actually say they know someone who has dies from it or have family members that have ? but you see the numbers on the news and just accept it?! all this distancing has got people disconnected so no one knows any different! \nSee, even the phrase 'numbers don't lie' is a lie.\n\nQUESTION EVERTHING.\n\n#questioneverything  #fakenews #Covid19 #theyrekillingus #NewWorldOrder #5g #stop5g #wifi #radiation #dontbefooled #freethinkers #conspiracytheory #truthseeker #knowledgeispower #wakeupsheeple #staywoke #downtherabbithole #agenda21 #agenda2030 #projectbluebeam #freeyourmind  #chemtrail #freeyourmind #gmo #revolution #tesla #freedomfighter #socialactivism #sunday",
