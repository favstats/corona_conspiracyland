    "description": "Our local Sheriff in Sonoma County, Essick, is one of those. He tried to reach out to the \u201cPublic Health Officer\u201d (who used to work for the Gates-funded CDC & WHO) multiple times asking why the lockdown orders are still in place for our county when we have a total of 4 \u201ccovid\u201d deaths (the testing is so flawed that those 4 might be false positives). \u2022\n\nHe was ignored and never replied to, so he declared that he will not be booking anyone into the jail for offenses related to opening up local businesses- as he should. \u2022\n\nSheriffs like these need to be supported. If you are one of the scared asleeple people not supporting them, and afraid of a \u201cvirus\u201d less deadly than seasonal flu, then you yourself stay home, mask up & wash your hands all day. \u2022\n\nAny time we drive our cars, we take a risk of dying. Should we ban driving, and \u201cshelter in place\u201d at home until no one dies from car accidents anymore? \ud83e\udd14 \u2022\n\nIt\u2019s time for the American people to stand tall and just say no to lockdown, social distancing, vaccines, and all the rest of the pandemic theater. \u2022\n\nDr. Pam Popper is a naturopath, an internationally recognized expert on nutrition, medicine & health, & the Executive Director of Wellness Forum Health. \u2022\n\nShe\u2019s a straight-talker who isn\u2019t afraid to criticize national health organizations, government agencies, medical professionals, pharmaceutical companies, agricultural organizations & manufacturing companies, many of whom have agendas & priorities that interfere with distributing truthful information & promoting public health. \u2022\n\nDr. Popper served as part of Dr. T. Colin Campbell\u2019s teaching team at eCornell, teaching part of a certification course on plant-based nutrition. \ud83c\udf31 \u2022\n\nShe\u2019s been featured in many documentaries, including \u201cProcessed People\u201d, \u201cMaking a Killing\u201d, & \u201cForks Over Knives\u201d. Her most recent book is \u201cFood Over Medicine: The Conversation That Can Save Your Life.\u201d \u2022\n\nSubscribe to Dr. Pam\u2019s weekly newsletter and video clips here:\n\nhttps://wellnessforumhealth.com/news/ \u2022 \u2022\n\u2022\n\n#mandatoryvaccinations #fight5G #eugenics #orderoutofchaos #chaosbydesign #contacttracing#coronavirus #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #martiallaw #covid1984 #plandemic",
