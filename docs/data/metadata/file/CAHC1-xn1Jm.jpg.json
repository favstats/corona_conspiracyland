Mr. Castillo did not punch him in the chest. THE OFFICER WAS A COWARD WHO GOT CHALLENGED AND WENT INTO A RAGE. Yall wonder why i day THEY ARE OUT OF CONTROL. Remember this is a job, BEING A POLICE OFFICER IS A JOB. Could you imagine losing your control like that at any other job. HOLD UP AND NOT BEING FIRED ????\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 While the world only has to deal with the CORONAVIRUS. Black people still have to deal with #Racism and #PoliceBrutality. Smh The attack on our people never stops. \n#POPULATIONCONTROL \n#corona  #coronavirus  #Hr6666 #TraceAct #COVID19 #Shutdown #Martiallaw #quarantine  #pandemic #5G #Vaccination\n#Coronachallege #coronamemes\n\nWatch as these gang members show their control over our communities. Using Violence, Aggressive, and Disrespectful words and behavior. They are nothing more then bullies. Most of them are racist. Joining the police allows them the power they want over the people they hate. They get a license to kill and traumatizes our people. THE POLICE ARE THE BIGGEST ORGANIZED GANG. THEY HAVE NEVER STOPPED MOVING AS SLAVE CATCHERS. \nI dont know if the answer is more BLACK cops especially when they hurt us worse. Just to prove they are one of the good ones to their white masters. \u2022 Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"\"fair use\"\" for purposes such as criticism. commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
