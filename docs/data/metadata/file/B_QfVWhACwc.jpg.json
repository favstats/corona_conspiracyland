That\u2019s reassuring. Everybody here has been vaccinated anyway.\n\nReporter # 1: USC and L.A. County Public Health came out with a study\u2014they found that there are seven thousand cases in #California but they really believe that there are anywhere from two hundred and twenty-one thousand to four hundred and forty-two thousand people who\u2019ve been infected.\n\nReporter # 2: Really? So that makes it zero point one to zero point three?\n\nReporter # 1: Yeah.\n\nReporter # 2: So that\u2019s a study they came out with or?\n\nReporter # 1: Yeah it just came out today.
