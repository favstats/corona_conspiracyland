    "description": "The UK's official coronavirus daily death count could be scrapped following an investigation into Public Health England's method of counting the toll, it has been claimed.\n\nThe conclusions of the probe, ordered by Health Secretary Matt Hancock after it emerged officials were \"\"exaggerating\"\" virus deaths, are expected this week, the Telegraph reports.\n\nOne recommendation could be to move to a weekly official death toll instead, a government source told the newspaper.\n\nBritain paused its daily update of the death toll last month and the government ordered a review into how Public Health England reports\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0deaths, after academics said the daily figures may include people who died of other causes.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#scamdemic #hoax #lies\n#plandemic2020 #fearmongering\n#agenda21 #id2020 #event201 #newworldorder #nwo #covidhoax2020 #covid19 #fearmongering #davidicke \n#thegreatawakening #wakeup #exposebillgates #london #uk #mirror",
