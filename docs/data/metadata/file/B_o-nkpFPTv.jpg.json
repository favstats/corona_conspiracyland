    "description": "Karl Marx has said that religion is the opiate of the masses.  However, we often fail to see how many of our modern institutions contain elements of religious dogma.  While modern medicine has significant benefits, especially in the realm of acute illness (fracture, accident, etc.) we often do not see where it may overstep its bounds like we are easily able to point out in religious traditions. \nEach religion is beautiful in its own right.  At the same time, throughout history all major religions have had their share of excess. \nDuring this time of the Covid-19 lockdown, \u2018pandemic\u2019 and global economic shutdown, it is important to keep in mind how modern medicine may overstep its bounds since so much of our collective attention and control has been given to prominent doctors in modern medicine (Fauci and Birx) and their funders (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). In further posts we will explore how each religion, including modern medicine, can have healthy coexistence with other perspectives, approaches and religions. \nDo you see any correlation between modern medicine and religion?
