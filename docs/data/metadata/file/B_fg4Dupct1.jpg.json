    "description": "We\u2019ve heard stories about CV patients worsening and dying from ventilators. Here\u2019s yet another account from a nurse practitioner speaking on behalf of a fellow nurse working at a NYC hospital, who wants to remain anonymous out of fear of losing her job. The accusations are horrifying. When CV patients are treated in the hospital, they\u2019re asked to sign a \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d form. Medical personnel in NY were recently advised to not resuscitate CV patients; to prevent the spread of the virus. So, what this nurse says doesn\u2019t sound so far fetched. . .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nvia @kellybroganmd @the_wake_up_q .\n.\n.\n#nursepractitioner #covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic #hydroxychloroquine #informedconsent #medicalfreedom #holistichealing #functionalmedicine #healthcareheroes #thegreatawakening #wwg1wga #inittogether #woke #thestorm #qanon #maga #exvaxxer #newyork #conservative #wakeupamerica #fakenews #truthseeker #coronavirus #truth #darktolight #patriotsfight #1a #saveamerica #godwins #unitednotdivided",
