    "description": "Premier Doug Ford appears to have broken Ontario's prescribed COVID-19 physical distancing measures, saying two of his daughters who live in different households visited his home over Mother's Day weekend.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at his daily briefing Monday, Ford said his family gathering was limited to six people, \"\"direct family\"\" only, with none of his daughters' husbands or boyfriends present. \"\"I really trust the judgment of the people of Ontario. If you have an elderly mother or father, and their health isn't great, I wouldn't chance it,\"\" Ford said.\n\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-physical-distancing-daughters-1.5564756\n\n#wedonotconsent #covid19 #covid #coronavirus #endthelockdown #freedom #nomandates #nomandatescanada #informedconsent #notobillgates #saynotobillgates #stopid2020 #reopencanada #nonewnormal #truth \n#reopencanqda #vaccinechoicecanada",
