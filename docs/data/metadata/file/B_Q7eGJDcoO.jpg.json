Gates\u2019 researchers are now testing the implant with a vaccine against the #COVID-19 virus. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nThe Gates-funded report boasts that the chip system will allow \u201chouse-to-house\u201d compliance searches to be conducted by \ud83d\udc6e\u200d\u2642\ufe0fgovernment enforcement teams\ud83d\udc6e\u200d\u2640\ufe0f with \u201cminimal training,\u201d and will \u201copen up new avenues for decentralized data storage and biosensing.\u201d The #MIT paper is titled \u201cBiocompatible near-infrared quantum dots delivered to the skin by microneedle patches to record vaccination.\u201d Gates began funding implantable tracking chips and ratio biotechnology in 2011 with a grant to TransDerm Inc. Gates is currently making multiple investments to develop different versions, including grants to Vaxxas Pty Ltd, Micron Biomedical Inc, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Vaxess Technologies Inc.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" -(Robert Kennedy Jr)",
