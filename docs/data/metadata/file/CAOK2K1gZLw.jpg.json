    "description": "Partners in Health was recently selected by Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker to conduct Coronavirus \u201ccontact tracing,\u201d a process that involves teams of investigators finding out who infected people have come into contact with.\nThe group is already \u201ctraining and deploying hundreds of contact tracers.\u201d Some citizens fear the potential for mass surveillance posed by contact tracing, especially in light of\u00a0a Democrat-introduced bill in Congress to authorize contact tracing \u201cat individuals\u2019 residences.\u201d\u00a0Partners In Health\u2019s involvement will not assuage many fears, considering the group has received funding from George Soros and Bill Gates organizations and counts Chelsea Clinton on its\u00a0board of trustees.\nPartners in Health\u00a0lists George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations as an official partner, along with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Partners In Health lists Open Society Foundations\u00a0on its 2015 annual report\u00a0as a supporter to the tune of $1 million or above, along with the Gates Foundation. Chelsea Clinton serves on Partners in Health\u2019s Board of Trustees,\u00a0according to its 2019 annual report. \nPartners in Health co-founder Paul Farmer\u2019s\u00a0achievement.org bio notes: \u201cFarmer\u2019s work attracted the support of philanthropists, including George Soros and Bill and Melinda Gates. In 2002, PIH received a $13 million grant from the Global Fund for improvements in the Cange complex. In 2005 the William J. Clinton Foundation funded a Partners in Health AIDS program in Rwanda.\u201d Farmer and Chelsea Clinton did a\u00a0Clinton Foundation podcast together in 2019.\nA #Plandemic at its highest form.. #GeorgeSoros #Soros #Clinton #FireFauci #BillGates #vaccines #CoronaVirus #Covid19 #massachusetts #GovCharlieBaker #CharlieBaker #CNN #BBC #FoxNews #MSNBC Bill #HR6666",
