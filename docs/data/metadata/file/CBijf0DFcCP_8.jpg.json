    "description": "As a white man I am ashamed of our race, our history, our government, and my lack of educating myself more about politics beforehand! Ive been educated about many things currently going on, but blind to all this BS. I dont stand for any type of racial supremacy, I believe in equality! I believe in respect! I dont believe in this!! For us to have allowed a known KKK member to run in Congress for the longest term in history is complete BULLSHIT!! I 100% sympathize with all black people as they have always been a target!! As a white man I have seen first hand the difference how police treat us & its just not right! AND THE PEOPLE WE HAVE LET RUN THIS COUNTRY IS WHY!! I Stand for the people ! You guys have my full support!! DEFUND OUR RACIST GOVERNMENT! (Drain the Swamp!!!) \u270a\u270a\ud83c\udfff\u270a\ud83c\udffe\u270a\ud83c\udffc\n\ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udd95 you KKK white ppl are a disgrace! I separate myself from you! Stay the hell away!!! .
