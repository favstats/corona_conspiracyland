Those members of the tree who do not adapt to the rules or traditions of the family system, those who were constantly seeking to revolutionize beliefs, going in contrast to roads marked by family traditions, those criticized, tried and even rejected, those, by General, they are called to release the tree of repetitive stories that frustrate entire generations. \nThe 'Black Sheep', those who do not adapt, those who scream rebel, repair, detoxify and create a new and blooming branch... countless unfulfilled desires, unfulfilled dreams, frustrated talents of our ancestors manifest themselves in their rebellion looking to take place. \nThe family tree, by inertia, will want to continue to maintain the castrating and toxic course of its trunk, which makes its task difficult and conflicting... that no one makes you doubt, take care of your 'rarity' as the most precious flower of Your Tree. \nYou are the dream of all your ancestors\"\" ~Bert Hellinger \nArtwork by Jeremy Enecio \n#aslongasthereisfreespeech #hiddeninplanesight #followthewhiterabbit #madworld #prisonplanet #newworldorder #1776 #agenda21 #agenda30 #event201 #covid_19 #5G #luciferian #worldwidelockdown #elite #government #wakeupsheeple #freedomthinker #illuminati #depopulation #eugenics #rfid #adrenochrome #georgiaguidestones #conspiracy #conscious #awareness #mindcontrol",
