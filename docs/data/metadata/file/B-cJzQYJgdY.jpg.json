    "description": "This spoken word poetry is a documentation of my environment. A witness of the pandemic, fast spreading corona virus across countries has put me in the state of analysis and deep thinking. Questioning being a habbit I wonder\nHow even if we have such great technology we are facing a wash and war with biology.\nHow could we exploit the animals to satisfy our taste buds, how we fearfully we watch the million man's labour March, how we look at the sensex dropping, I ask you all what was it that we started it with? Wasnt the intension to make life simple? How did we end up here in this greedy, ruthlessly unreasonably monstrous form?\nWasnt nature giving us enough? The cool breeze the beautiful sky the pleasant smile when we watched a flower bloom?\nWhat is that we lacked? \nQuestioning this in my present situation of my lockdown.\n#washhands #stayhome #quarantine #lockdown #invention #innovation #widespread #corona #virus #pandemic #animalfarming #wildanimals #foodondemand #consumer #stayhome #economy #economiccondition #nature #brutal #hypocrisy #coronavirus #covid #5g #id2020 #nature #beauty #godisnature #naturalliving #sustainability #simplicity #naturessolider #protectnature",
