    "description": "We all see the world from unique perspectives, forming different perceptions and beliefs and pursuing individual goals. Thus, to effectively interact with others, we often have to juggle various viewpoints and even choose between conflicting perspectives: we each understand the world and situation according to OUR experiences; we think and understand and interpret the world as far as our minds have been stretched. We can still be friends with a difference of opinion unless your ego plays a part. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f You see, I do believe in aliens, and the multiverse and time travel and the spiritual realm, and the healing powers of crystals,herbs and certain frequencies of music, also that 9/11 was an inside job and a lot more. I also believe the world is full of good and evil constantly at play. You might see pedophile jokes/humor just as a joke, in humor or sarcasm, but I see it as an attempt to normalize it. It is what it is, you don\u2019t have to agree but please understand you can not push your views into me. Keep scrolling or unfollow if your ego is that big. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb #NotASheep #Perspective #differentViews #Pizzagate #Pedogate #frazzledrip #andrenochrome #MKUltra #MindControl #ForcedVaccines #Covid19 #FearMongering #HiddenAgenda #RFIDchip #BillGates #GeorgeSoros #JefferyEpstein #pedophelia #PedoWood #SaveTheChildren #WayFair #5G #Fluoride #sextrafficking #childtrafficking #Spiritual #Growth #Multiverse #DifferentDimensions #StarSeed \u2b50\ufe0f",
