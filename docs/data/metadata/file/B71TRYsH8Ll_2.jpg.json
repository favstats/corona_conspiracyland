Makes ya wonder if this outbreak was on purpose... http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/videos.html\nA \u2018High-Level Exercise\u2019 Conducted 3 Months Ago Showed That A Coronavirus Pandemic Could Kill 65 Million People\nJust over three months ago, a \u201chigh-level pandemic exercise\u201d entitled \u201cEvent 201\u201d was held in New York City.  On October 18th the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in conjunction with the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, brought together \u201c15 leaders of business, government, and public health\u201d to simulate a scenario in which a coronavirus pandemic was ravaging the planet.  The current coronavirus outbreak that originated in China did not begin until December, and so at that time it was supposedly just a hypothetical exercise.  The following comes from the official page for this event\u2026\nI find it quite interesting that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was involved, because they are also financial backers of the institute that was granted a U.S. patent for \u201can attenuated coronavirus\u201d in November 2018.\nhttps://dcdirtylaundry.com/a-high-level-exercise-conducted-3-months-ago-showed-that-a-coronavirus-pandemic-could-kill-65-million-people/\n#billgates #coronavirus #pandemic #virus  #chineselunarnewyear #event201 #agenda21 #depopulation #vaccines #billandmelindagatesfoundation #fear #planned #followthemoney",
