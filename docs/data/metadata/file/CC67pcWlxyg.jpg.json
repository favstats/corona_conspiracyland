Edward Griffin, author of \u201cThe Creature from Jekyll Island\u201d, was asked to record a summary of his view of the COVID-19 scamdemic, and this is his spontaneous response. \n\nThere is an abundance of bad science to be seen in pandemic statistics, attempts to flatten the curve, and touting vaccines as the ultimate solution. \n\nMuch of this also involves fraud and deception, so there is more to it than simply making an honest mistake. \n\nWhat, then, could the motive be? \n\nMr. Griffin answers: money and power \u2013 money to be made by the pharmaceutical industry, and power to be gained by the political industry. \n\nThese forces have partnered to spread fear to anesthetize the public\u2019s ability to question the official narrative.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#covid1984 #orderoutofchaos #mandatoryvaccinations #chaosbydesign\n#fight5G #eugenics #contacttracing #maskhole #coronavirus #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #transhumanistagenda #artificialintelligence #problemreactionsolution #scamdemic #conspiracyreality #covidiots #5G #geoengineering #climatechangehoax #wtc7 #soros #billgates #rothschild #rockefeller #depopulation #technocracy #kill5G #electromagneticwaronhumanity",
