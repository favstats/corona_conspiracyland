    "description": "Yes, my friends. This is my state. Our tyrant governor will not allow parents to take their kids to the playground, \"\"non-essential\"\" businesses to be open, or for people to have visitors in their home. He insists that people wear masks in stores and stay 6 ft away from everyone else. All of this, he does in the name of \"\"safety.\"\" Yet...safety didn't seem to cross his mind when he chose to start releasing prisoners early due to Covid-19. The man in this incident was in prison for kidnapping and raping a woman around New Year's Day. He was in prison for a mere 3 1/2 months before being set free because of the plandemic.\n\nWe knew this would happen. Our government ceased being concerned with protecting our rights a long time ago. If you can't see this is about control, then you need to stay out of the way of those of us who DO, because we're not only fighting for ourselves. We're fighting for you.\n\n#plandemic  #theresnoplacelikehome #tyranny #totalitarianism #bigpharma #nwo #NewWorldOrder #redpilled #wakeup #speakup #riseup #beforeitstoolate #wedonotconsent #idonotconsent #realeyesrealizereallies #openyoureyes #truth #greatawakening #Covid19 #coronavirus",
