    "description": "Climate report by Gates\n\nBill Gates warns of another looming crisis that could be worse than the coronavirus. Gates estimates 3 million people could die by 2100 if climate change is not stopped.\n\n\u201cTo understand the kind of damage that climate change will inflict, look at COVID-19 and spread the pain out over a much longer period.\u201d\n\n\"\"Within the next 40 years, increases in global temperatures are projected to raise global mortality rates by the same amount\u201414 deaths per 100,000. By the end of the century, if emissions growth stays high, climate change could be responsible for\u00a073\u00a0extra deaths per 100,000 people. In a lower emissions scenario, the death rate drops to 10 per 100,000. In other words, by 2060, climate change could be just as deadly as COVID-19, and by 2100 it could be five times as deadly.\"\"\n\nThat title only makes sense if you prefix each of those two sentances with the words \"\"The removal of your freedoms justified by our hoax.\n\n#wakeupsheeple #wwg1wga #fuckthegoverment #followthemoney #populationcontrol #doyourownresearch #plandemic #scamdemic #hoax #agenda2030 #corona #virus #thegreatawakening #nwo #NEWWORLDORDER #martiallaw #woke #Fuckbillgates #covid19 #billandmelindagatesfoundation #downtherabbithole #hiddenagenda #WAKETHEFUCKUP",
