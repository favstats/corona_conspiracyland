The PCR tests they're doing don't test for viruses, they test for Rna and DNA which is easy to prove as they are the basis of all viruses. But as you should know, those viruses only become illnesses when the body is so overwhelmed with toxicity that it needs to create a virus to clean you out. Viruses are NOT transmissible from one person to the next, viruses are NOT contagious! The only way to get a virus is through a injection directly into your bloodstream. Scientific fact! Do your research and the truth will set us all free - but it starts with you.\n.\n.\nMediaistheVirus #protests \n#virusesareNOTcontagious\n#virus #corona  #immunesystem #terraintheory\u00a0 #truthseekers #notmyvirus\u00a0 #SocialDistancing #yoga  #firefauci #fuckBillGates #billgates #ID2020 #event201 #notmyvirus #filmyourhospital #flattenthecurve #gatesfoundation #AmericaFirst #falseflag #coronavirus #healthandwellness #Davidicke\n#covid19 #flattenthecurve #londonrealarmy #candiceowens #citizenjournalism",
