    "description": "According to the video uploader, the short film was shot in Napoli. That\u2019s in the south of Italy and shows the Covid-19 has already invaded this part of the country.\nHis sister, killed by Covid-19, lies dead in his bed and he doesn\u2019t get any help.\nHe is trapped at home with her body and doesn\u2019t get any advises from doctors and government officials.\nHe cannot bury her, funeral services refuses to collect her body, priests don\u2019t want to visit him, he\u2019s being left abandoned by everybody.\nHe has put himself in quarantine\u2026 But a dead body disintegrates, putrefies and thus needs some cares. If he doesn\u2019t get help soon his place will\u00a0look and stink like an Iranian morgue.\nThe family of Teresa Franzese, 47, who died of coronavirus in the\u00a0southwestern city of Naples\u00a0was forced to keep her body at home for more than 36 hours as funeral services refused to transport the body. \nShe developed symptoms\u00a0associated with COVID-19 earlier in the week and died on Saturday evening. She suffered from a form of epilepsy but was otherwise in good health.\nThe truth about the Italian coronavirus situation is horrifying, almost terrifying! \n#JesusIsComing #SignsOfTheTimes #PredictiveProgramming #Heath #Tukkit #Future #Beastmode #MartialLaw #NewYork #CashlessSociety #Virus #ConspiracyTheory #FalseFlag #Truth #WakeUp #OpenYourEyes #Tech #Quarantine #COVid19 #NewWorldOrder #MarkOfTheBeast #Awakening #Cashless #WakeUp #EndTimes #ComingSoon #Prepare #5g",
