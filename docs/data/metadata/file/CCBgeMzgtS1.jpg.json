    "description": "Cognitive dissonance melts away in 'for the time being'\n\nIf you know a melody well and someone sings it differently, it may sound like cheating to you\n\nIf you have accepted a belief and someone is breaking it down,\ncan feel that to you as an attack on your faith\n\nIf you have studied a subject, you apply your knowledge in your work, and something is said that is not consistent with it, which may feel like an attack on your professional knowledge.\n\nSomething else can also happen.\n\nYou may not feel attacked at all, your curiosity aroused, you want to tell about your truth, but also want to know why the other person presents something different as true, that you start a conversation, understand why the other person thinks what he thinks and tell what you think.\n\nMaybe they always sang that melody somewhere else... did the preachers in that other belief teach that to all their believers... or did you think that your professional knowledge was too one-sided... If you give everything you have learned the space of the for the time being, as science should do, guard the survival of your curiosity against overly firm beliefs,\nallow yourself to be interested in what you initially tended to reject,\ngive yourself and your mind the gift of space and freedom.\n\nLietje Perizonius\n\n#5G60gigahertz #aslongasthereisfreespeech #hiddeninplanesight #followthewhiterabbit #madworld #prisonplanet #newworldorder #1776 #agenda21 #agenda30 #event201 #covid_19 #5G #luciferian #worldwidelockdown #elite #government #wakeupsheeple #freedomthinker #illuminati #depopulation #eugenics #rfid #adrenochrome #georgiaguidestones #conspiracy #conscious #awareness #mindcontrol",
