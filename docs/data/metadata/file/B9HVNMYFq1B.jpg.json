    "description": "Seeing this display of mockery reminds me of Revelation 16 with the vials are poured out during the tribulation. Instead of repenting and turning to God because of the plagues those left behind blaspheme the God of Heaven. Pray for the lost. \ud83d\udcd6 Revelation 16:8-11 \ud83d\udcd6\n8\u00a0And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.\n9\u00a0And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.\n10\u00a0And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,\n11\u00a0And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.\n#JesusIsComingSoon #Repent #EndOfTheWorld #EndTimes #AreYouReady #Tukkit #SignsOfTheTimes #Health #SpiritualWarfare #ClimateChange #Coronavirus #JesusSaves #Pestilence #Yolo #Wuhan #China #StephenColbert #Sick #Prepper #Deception #LastDays #MarkOfTheBeast #Prophecy #NewWorldOrder #Distractions",
