    "description": "On 1 July 1946, the United States conducted the first nuclear test after World War II. The explosion took place at the Bikini Atoll lagoon, situated in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean. Test Able was to be the first of a series of 67 tests in the atoll and the second US nuclear test of over a thousand to follow. \n\nThe explosion of the fission bomb, largely identical to the weapon used in the attack on Nagasaki on 9 August 1945, occurred 158 metres above sea level and had a yield of 23 kilotons. The main aim was to test the effects of nuclear weapons on ships. To that end, a fleet of 78 vessels, many of which had been captured during World War II, was anchored in the lagoon. The blast sunk only five of them, leaving another 14 seriously damaged. -CTBTO preparatory commission \n\n#lebanon do you still think it was fireworks? \n\n#5G60gigahertz #aslongasthereisfreespeech #hiddeninplanesight #followthewhiterabbit #madworld #prisonplanet #newworldorder #1776 #agenda21 #agenda30 #event201 #covid_19 #5G #luciferian #worldwidelockdown #elite #government #wakeupsheeple #freedomthinker #illuminati #depopulation #eugenics #rfid #adrenochrome #georgiaguidestones #conspiracy #conscious #awareness #mindcontrol",
