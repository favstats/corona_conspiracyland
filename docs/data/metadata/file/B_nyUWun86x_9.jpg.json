In fact, the question is not medical but legal and philosophical. Whether legislation that makes vaccination mandatory would be constitutional under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is an open question, but it would undoubtedly conflict with the common law principle that you have autonomy over your own body, even where life hangs in the balance. That principle does not change depending on whose life it is. The needs of the many do not outweigh the rights of the few, or the one.\n\nhttps://m.theepochtimes.com/even-during-a-pandemic-the-needs-of-the-many-do-not-outweigh-the-rights-of-the-few_3333641.html\n\n#wedonotconsent #covid19 #covid #coronavirus #endthelockdown #freedom #nomandates #nomandatescanada #informedconsent #notobillgates #saynotobillgates #stopid2020 #reopencanada #nonewnormal #truth \n#reopencanqda #vaccinechoicecanada",
