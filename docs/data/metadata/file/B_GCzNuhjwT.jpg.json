    "description": "#BillGates has invested millions of dollars in technology that embeds a \u201cvaccination record\u201d under the skin that will allow government officials to \u201cscan U.S. citizens\u201d with smartphones to detect their compliance, according to @RobertFKennedyJr.\nA disturbing study funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and published in December 2019 boasts the \u201cunder the skin\u201d technology will allow \u201chouse-to-house\u201d compliance searches to be conducted by government enforcement teams with \u201cminimal training,\u201d and will \u201copen up new avenues for decentralized data storage and biosensing.\u201d While there is no evidence Gates is planning to use the \u201ctag and track\u201d technology in tandem with a vaccination to fight #covid19, Kennedy Jr. is urging concerned citizens to \u201ccontact Bill Gates on his social media\u201d and \u201cGently explain that tagging and tracking humans may appeal to his government cronies in #totalitarian #China, but those activities are inconsistent with #American values and traditions.\u201c The MIT paper is titled \u201cBiocompatible near-infrared quantum dots delivered to the skin by microneedle patches to record vaccination\u201d and can be accessed behind a paywall here.\nMedicalXpress.com reported on the news that MIT researchers \u201cdeveloped a novel way to record a patient\u2019s vaccination history: storing the data in a pattern of dye, invisible to the naked eye, that is delivered under the skin at the same time as the vaccine.\u201c \u201cIn areas where paper vaccination cards are often lost or do not exist at all, and electronic databases are unheard of, this technology could enable the rapid and anonymous detection of patient vaccination history to ensure that every child is vaccinated,\u201d says Kevin McHugh, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor of bioengineering at #RiceUniversity.\nLast week Kennedy Jr. slammed the billionaire philanthropist, accusing him of having a \u201cmessianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology.\u201d \ud83d\udd90\ud83c\udffeMore in comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe#Technocracy #ScientificDictatorship #NewWorldOrder #ID2020 #MarkOfTheBeast",
