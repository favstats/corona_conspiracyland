    "description": "Sweden\u2019s response has not been perfect, but it has succeeded in bolstering immunity among the young and the healthy\u2014those at the lowest risk of serious complications from COVID-19\u2014while also flattening the curve. The country\u2019s intensive care units have not been overrun, and hospital staffs, although under strain, have at least not had to juggle additional childcare responsibilities because daycares and lower schools continue to operate. \nWhether or not they have openly embraced the Swedish approach, many other countries are now trying to emulate aspects of it. Both Denmark and Finland have reopened schools for young children. Germany is allowing small shops to reopen. Italy will soon reopen parks, and France has a plan to allow some nonessential businesses to reopen, including farmers\u2019 markets and small museums, as well as schools and daycare centers. In the United States, which has by far the highest absolute number of reported COVID-19 deaths, several states are easing restrictions at the urging of President Donald Trump, who despite bashing the Swedish model, is pushing the country toward something very similar.\n\nhttps://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/sweden/2020-05-12/swedens-coronavirus-strategy-will-soon-be-worlds\n\n#wedonotconsent #covid19 #covid #coronavirus #endthelockdown #freedom #nomandates #nomandatescanada #informedconsent #notobillgates #saynotobillgates #stopid2020 #reopencanada #nonewnormal #truth \n#reopencanqda #vaccinechoicecanada",
