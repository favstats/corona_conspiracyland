    "description": "An estimated 8 million children are said to go missing each year, worldwide. Around 800,000 are from the United States, 40,000 each year in Brazil, 50,500 in Canada, 39,000 in France, 100,000 in Germany, 45,000 in Mexico, and an estimated 230,000 go missing in the United Kingdom every year. If you ask me this is way bigger and more sinister than any fake pandemic and/or racism in our world.\n#coronavirus #covid19 #event21 #agenda21 #plandemic #wuhan #worldhealthorganization #CDC #2020 #billgates #arrestbillgates #firefauci #wethepeople #humanity #NWO #humantrafficing #pizzagate #frazzledrip #pedowood #pedogate #Hollywood #hollyweird #protectthechildren #creepyjoebiden #johnpodesta #hilaryforprison #anthonyweinerslaptop #fallcabal #childabduction #humantraffickingawareness",
