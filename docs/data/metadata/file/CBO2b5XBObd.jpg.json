It is debatable whether asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers are contagious. We report here a case of the asymptomatic patient and present clinical characteristics of 455 contacts, which aims to study the infectivity of asymptomatic carriers.\n\nIn summary, all the 455 contacts were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infection and we conclude that the infectivity of some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers might be weak.\"\" Link to the study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32405162/\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/asymptomatic-coronavirus-patients-arent-spreading-new-infections-who-says.html\n\n#covid19 #coronavirus #scamdemic #plandemic #covidiots #corruption #economicrecession",
