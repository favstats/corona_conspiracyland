    "description": "It\u2019s good for your skin too. Charcoal is literally good for everything, activated charcoal is so expensive and it\u2019s just burnt wood before it becomes ashes. You just wanna cut off the oxygen from the wood burning when it\u2019s red hot and there you go you have charcoal. I bought this ground up activated charcoal powder for teeth whitening\u2026 I got this little container for like 25 bucks... now I have 100 times that amount that I just made myself for free. whoever tricked the world and created the term activated charcoal made a fortune off of retards. I was one of those retards. \n-\n\n#5GKills #Stop5G #MarkOfTheBeast #5GAsAWeapon #MicrowaveTechnology #SilentWeaponsForQuietWars #FlatEarth #RFIDChip #Firmament #ItsFlat #ItsStillFlat #SpaceIsFake #NASALies #CoronaIs5G #2ndamendment #squirt #soyboy #WakeUp #Woke #yeet",
