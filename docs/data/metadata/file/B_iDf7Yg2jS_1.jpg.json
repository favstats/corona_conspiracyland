    "description": "Sweet justice . \nAttorney General William Barr is considering taking legal action against governors who continue to impose draconian, #unconstitutional rules for dealing with the #coronavirus.\n\nHarsh restrictions such as #stayathome orders and shutting down businesses are justified up to a point, Barr said in an interview Tuesday on \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show.\u201d Eventually, though, states should move to fairer more targeted measures, Barr said. \u201cWe have to give #businesses more freedom to operate in a way that\u2019s reasonably safe,\u201d Barr said. \u201cTo the extent that governors don\u2019t and impinge on either #civilrights or on the national commerce \u2014 our common market that we have here \u2014 then we\u2019ll have to address that.\u201d Yahoo News reports: Barr\u2019s comments come as the #Trumpadministration and states are struggling \u2014 and at times fighting with each other \u2014 over the best strategy to deal with the crisis. Trump has stoked tensions with some Democratic governors who are dealing with protests against stringent #socialdistancing rules, even as his administration backs guidelines that call for states to open up gradually.\n\nOne way the Justice Department might act against state or local officials is by joining #lawsuits brought by citizens or businesses over restrictions, Barr said. He acknowledged that state governments are at \u201ca sensitive stage,\u201d as they try to balance health and safety against pressure to reopen. But he said that \u201cas lawsuits develop, as specific cases emerge in the states, we\u2019ll take a look at them.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re looking carefully at a number of these rules that are being put into place,\u201d Barr said. \u201cAnd if we think one goes too far, we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them. And if they\u2019re not and people bring lawsuits, we file statement of interest and side with the plaintiffs.\n.\n.\n.\n #OperationGridLock #dontbelievethelies #dontbelievethehype #bigthingshappening #backroundnoise #deepstate #hospital #filmyourhospital #clintons #distraction #hoax #corona #virus #coronavirus #hystaria #media #manipulation #panic #wwg1wga #anon #q #unreal #lies",
