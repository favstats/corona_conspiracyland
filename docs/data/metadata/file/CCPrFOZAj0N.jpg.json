Now, for all we know, he could be Joe\u2019s running mate. Why not?\u201d -Taken from National Insiders .\n.\n.\n.\n. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u2694\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8Make sure to follow\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb@NJ_Punisher_Fatale \n\n#Trump #Trump2020 #politics #JoeBiden #MAGA #independenceday #scamdemic #Fauci #Trumpmemes #4thofjuly #Americafirst #politicalmemes #2ndamendment #conservatives #GOP #Republican #Libertarian #conservativememes #COVID #CoronaVirus #AllLivesMatter #DonaldTrump #proguns #foxnews #fakenews #China #POTUS #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #WWG1WGA\nSupport my friends:\n@anne.bonny_ \n@mary_.read \n@archangels.of.america \n@tallpoppymedia \n@simply_patriotic_\n@kagbabe \nPartners:\n@conservatives4trump_45 \n@deplorable_brandysthebomb \n@warriormomusa \n@victorious_jenny \n@newyork4trump \n@secretary.of.memes\n@oriana_is_back\n@wetonia \n@trumptriggersliberals",
