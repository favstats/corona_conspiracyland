    "description": "Novak Djokovic faces a dilemma if it becomes compulsory for players to get vaccinated before they can begin competing once the tennis season resumes following the hiatus created by the coronavirus pandemic, the world number one said on Sunday. \u201cPersonally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn\u2019t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,\u201d Djokovic said in a live facebook chat with several fellow Serbian athletes. \u201cBut if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision. I have my own thoughts about the matter and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don\u2019t know.\n\nhttps://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/djokovic-s-opposition-to-vaccine-could-stop-return-to-tennis-1.4233116\n\n#wedonotconsent #covid19 #covid #coronavirus #freedom #endthelockdown #informedconsent #nomandates #nomandatescanada #notobillgates #saynotobillgates #willnotstaysilent #nonewnormal #truth #reopencanada",
