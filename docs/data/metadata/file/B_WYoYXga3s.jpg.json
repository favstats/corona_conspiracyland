    "description": "Its neighbors closed borders, schools, bars and businesses as the coronavirus pandemic swept through Europe, but Sweden went against the grain by keeping public life as unrestricted as possible.\n\nThe strategy \u2014 aimed at allowing some exposure to the virus in order to build immunity among the general population while protecting high-risk groups like the elderly \u2014 has been controversial. Some health experts liken it to playing Russian roulette with public health.\n\nBut now, the country\u2019s chief epidemiologist said the strategy appears to be working and that \u201cherd immunity\u201d could be reached in the capital Stockholm in a matter of weeks.\n\nPremium: SWEDEN-HEALTH-VIRUS-SPRING\nRemember what this felt like? People enjoy the warm spring weather at Hornstull in Stockholm on April 21, 2020, during the new coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic.\nJONATHAN NACKSTRAND\n\u201cIn major parts of Sweden, around Stockholm, we have reached a plateau (in new cases) and we\u2019re already seeing the effect of herd immunity and in a few weeks\u2019 time we\u2019ll see even more of the effects of that. And in the rest of the country, the situation is stable,\u201d Dr. Anders Tegnell, chief epidemiologist at Sweden\u2019s Public Health Agency, told CNBC on Tuesday.\n\nHerd immunity among a population, usually achieved through vaccination, is reached when around 60% of citizens are deemed immune. Without a vaccine for the coronavirus, however, scientists are looking at whether exposure to and recovery from Covid-19 leads to long-term immunity. Some reinfections, or reactivations, of the coronavirus have been reported.\n\n#herdimmunity #naturalhealing #antivax #immunesupport #believemothers #sweden #holistichealth #facts #truth #covid_19 #quarantine #plandemic #informedconsent",
