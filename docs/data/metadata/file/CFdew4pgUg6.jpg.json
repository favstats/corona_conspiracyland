I\u2019m sorry for those who don\u2019t understand how health, disease, viruses, immune system function and toxicity work but everything you\u2019ve been told is essentially a lie. \nYou don\u2019t catch sickness or disease you create it by being in toxic overload and living a life that was about momentary pleasures rather than doing what increases bodily function, vitality and health.\n\nFOLLOW \ud83d\udc49 @miri.p.swiss.truths \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\nFOR MORE CONTENT AND TRUTH! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n#fuckbillgates #fuckthecdc #healthylifestyle #populationcontrol \n#plannedemic  #georgiaguidestones #saynotomasks \n#shadowgovernment #governmentconspiracy #Covid1984 #agenda21 #agenda2030 #wedonotconsent #predictiveprogramming #theworldisastage #microchip #mkultra  #markofthebeast #scamdemic #governmentcorruption #bigpharma #newworldorderagenda #truthinplainsight #questioneverything #rockefellerfoundation #id2020 #event201 #falseflags #femacamps",
