    "description": "Remarkable images show children at a Thai nursery playing together while in their own social distanced pods.\n\nThe Wat Khlong Toey School in Bangkok, Thailand, reopened its doors to its 250 students at the beginning of July after the relaxation of Covid-19 lockdown measures.\n\nBut the nursery now looks a very different picture.\n\nSocial distanced screens are in classrooms and lunch areas to protect the kids who wear face masks.\n\nThe kindergarten has also installed sinks, soap dispensers and hand sanitiser outside of each classroom.\n\nThere is also a temperature scanner at the entrance for when the young pupils arrive.\n\nIn one photo, the kids can be seen standing in squares as they sing a song about washing their hands.\n.\n.\n.\n#plandemic2020 #scamdemic #covidhoax #id2020 #event201 #agenda21 #agenda21depopulationplan #eugenecist #depopulationagenda #deepstate #shadowgovernment #trilatteralcommission #conspiracy #freedom #agenda2030 #truth \n#thegreatreset #newworldorder #thailand #puppets #prisonersofwar  #thegreatawakening",
