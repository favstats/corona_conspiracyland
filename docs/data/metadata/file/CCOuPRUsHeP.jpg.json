    "description": "New \u201ccases\u201d of COVID-19 hit record levels in recent days, but the number of fatalities has stabilized in the last few days at a level well below its peak. Deaths are either falling or holding steady. \n\nThe vast majority of fatalities involve seniors and individuals with chronic underlying health conditions. CDC Director Robert Redfield attributed the spike in cases across the United States to \u201cmany factors to include increased testing, community transmission, and outbreaks in settings such as nursing homes and occupational settings.\u201d \n\nIn response, some of the most populous states and cities have paused or rolled back their reopening plans. [What Redfield failed to mention is that the tests are incapable of distinguishing between COVID-19 and many other viruses, including seasonal flu.]\n\nFor all we know, the so-called \u201ccases\u201d of COVID-19 could be responses to other things. The entire charade of \u201ccase\u201d statistics is theater & propaganda, not science.\n\n\u2022\n\nArticle:\n\nhttps://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/07/01/coronavirus-deaths-in-u-s-plunge-in-recent-weeks-as-new-cases-hit-record-levels/\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#mandatoryvaccinations #fight5G #eugenics #orderoutofchaos #chaosbydesign #contacttracing #coronavirus #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #transhumanistagenda #artificialintelligence #covid1984  #problemreactionsolution #scamdemic #conspiracyreality #covidiots #5G #geoengineering #climatechangehoax #wtc7 #soros #billgates #rothschild #rockefeller #depopulation #technocracy #kill5G #electromagneticwaronhumanity",
