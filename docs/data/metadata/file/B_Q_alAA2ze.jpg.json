    "description": "If you choose to wear a mask and gloves that is your choice. But, that should not mean I should have to also. \nIf you believe that your mask truly protects you, then me choosing not to wear one, will not effect you at all. \nI think this exercise in freedom grabbing has shown us who will be the first to accept the Mark of the Beast. \nOur freedoms are being taken by fear. These mandates to wear masks and gloves to put people at ease, to make them \u201cfeel\u201d safe are just that. To make you \u201cfeel\u201d. We know.... the left operates on feelings. Their feelings over facts and over other humans. Don\u2019t forget the government has to look as if they care, as if the millions of tax dollars they give \u201cexpert\u2019s\u201d like Fauci and Brix are paying off. \ud83d\ude44\nPeople are willing to give up their FREEDOMS for the False sense of being safe. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f 9/11 proved that. \nThey won\u2019t stop here... as I have said.. the next plandemic will be worse. \nThey will demand everyone get vaccinated for \u201cyour own safety\u201d. Something Hitler said often. \nPeople are sheep. Fear will be our demise if we don\u2019t fight back. \n#fearless #factsoverfeelings #truth #covid_19 #plandemic #freedom #revolution #wethepeople #iwillnotcomply #1stamendment #2amendment #constitutionalrights #constitution #billofrights #libertyordeath #billgates #id2020",
