    "description": "Many still believe the total number of Coronavirus deaths on the news to be accurate. But, thousands of similar stories circulating on social media are saying otherwise - that their loved ones didn\u2019t die from COVID-19, yet their death certificates say they did. .\n.\nThe number of CV deaths are overestimated. If someone is suspected to have died from CV and didn\u2019t get tested, the cause of death is listed as CV.  This is confirmed in the CDC guidelines for certifying CV deaths. .\n.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-1-Guidance-for-Certifying-COVID-19-Deaths.pdf\n.\nWill we ever get an accurate snapshot of the real numbers? Most likely not. .\n.\nPennsylvania recently overturned 306 CV deaths after coroners raised red flags showing their deaths weren\u2019t caused by CV. This is just one state. But, what about the other 49 states? What about the rest of the world? .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nvia @circleofmamas @thetruthaboutvaccines\n.\n\n#coronavirus #covid19 #novelcoronavirus #pandemic #scandemic #informedconsent #medicalfreedom #holistichealing #truthseeker #fakenews #thegreatawakening #wwg1wga #inittogether #woke #thestorm #qanon #wakeupamerica #truth #darktolight #unitednotdivided",
