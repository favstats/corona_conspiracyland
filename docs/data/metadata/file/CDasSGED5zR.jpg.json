The higher the frequency, the shorter the length of each wave. This means more waves hit our bodies in the same amount of time. Previous cellular generations emitted from 1 to 6 GHz frequencies. 5G cell towers may emit frequencies as high as 300 GHz.\n\nSecond, 5G technology requires \u201cultra high intensity\u201d. Since the shorter length millimeter waves (MMV) used in 5G do not travel as far (and get obstructed easier), with our current number of cell towers the cell signal will not be reliable. To compensate 5G cell towers will have to emit the lower 3G & 4G waves as well, and many more \u201cmini cell towers\u201d will have to be installed. It is estimated that they will need a mini cell tower every 2 to 8 houses. All of this combined will greatly increase our RF Radiation exposure.\n\ud83c\udff9\nReferensi: https://www.radiationhealthrisks.com/5g-cell-towers-dangerous/\n\ud83c\udff9\n#newworldorder #nwo #tolak5g #dajjal #berdikari #konspirasi #PandemicCurrency #conspiracy #stop5g #stop5gbali #stop5gindonesia #akhirzaman #covid19 #JournalStop5G #psbb #indonesiaberdikari #5G #newnormal #corner #islandofgods #microwave #gigantic #id2020 #TheOldOfIntelligentsia #indonesian_flatearth_society\n#indonesiantruthseekersociety",
