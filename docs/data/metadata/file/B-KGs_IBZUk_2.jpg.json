This clearly shows that the #CDC was planning a #quarantine program before the #coronavirus \u201cpandemic\u201d and actively began recruiting for positions on November 15, 2019, well before the first case of #Covid19 was even known about.\nIf this listing gets scrubbed, it should be available on archive.org, but who knows anymore. There is more to the listing, but you get the general idea. The representative for the quarantine program is there to \u201cdevelop and present training to various governmental agencies and local partners on emergency response protocols, communicable diseases and quarantine activities.\u201d Just so we\u2019re all on the same page regarding the timing of this posting, here is the timeline of the \u201coutbreak\u201d as put together by Axios.\nIt seems the CDC was well aware of what was coming, just like #BillGates and the #WorldEconomicForum, who put on #Event201 on October 18, 2019, simulating a deadly coronavirus pandemic.",
