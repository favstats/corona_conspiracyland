Basement dwellers and corona Karen's will still be begging for protection though. \nFor those of you still wiping down groceries and other packages amid the ongoing\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0pandemic, breathe a sigh of relief: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now says the novel virus \u201cdoes not spread easily\u201d from \"\"\"\"touching surfaces or objects\"\"\"\"\u00a0\u2014 but experts warn that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s no longer necessary to take \"\"\"\"practical and realistic\"\"\"\" precautions in stopping the spread of COVID-19.\nThough when the change was made is not currently clear,\u00a0the federal health agency appears to have subtly shifted its guidelines from\u00a0March which simply said it \u201cmay be possible\u201d to spread the virus from contaminated surfaces.\n\"\"\"\"It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,\"\"\"\" the CDC said on a\u00a0now-archived page\u00a0from March 28. At the time, however, the CDC did\u00a0note\u00a0that this possible\u00a0method of transmission \"\"\"\"is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\"\"\"\"\nEven so, the CDC\u00a0now includes \"\"\"\"surfaces or objects\"\"\"\" under a section that details ways in which the coronavirus\u00a0does not readily transmit.\nOther ways in which the virus does not easily spread is from animals to people, or from people to animals, the federal agency\u00a0said on its updated page.\n\u201cCOVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about how it spreads. It may be possible for COVID-19 to spread in other ways, but these are not thought to be the main ways the virus spreads,\u201d according to\u00a0the CDC.\n.\n.\n.\n#dontbelievethelies #dontbelievethehype #bigthingshappening #backroundnoise #deepstate #hospital #filmyourhospital #clintons #distraction #hoax #corona #virus #coronavirus #hystaria #media #manipulation #panic #wwg1wga #anon #q #unreal #lies #msm #mainstreammedia #news #investigativejournalism #truth",
