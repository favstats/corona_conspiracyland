The staff then entered the house and took the residents one by one and sent them to the ambulance. The male head of the household questioned the staff members for breaking the law and fiercely resisted. During this period, the staff members' protective clothing was broken and they tried to hide under the car.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" Local media, QQ.COM, reported that some residents in Jiangsu were being locked in their homes by authorities. \nSeveral videos document how authorities mounted metal tubing across people's front doors to prevent them from leaving. \nIn one video, it shows a person inside an apartment, who can't leave because authorities mounted metal piping across the door frame.\nAs of Monday night, total confirmed cases of #coronavirus in #China exceeded 20,500, deaths hit 425 (427 if we count two deaths abroad), and 171,329 cases under observation.\nChina has shut down over a dozen cities and made it mandatory that more than 50 million people stay home while the virus runs its course. #JesusSaves #Repent #Biowarfare #MedicalMartialLaw #Event201 #Tukkit #SignsOfTheTimes #CurrentSituation #WakeUp #Prepare #Fast #Pray #BillGates #Health",
