    "description": "Everybody who is supposed to be a trusted authority on pandemics has been caught lying from the start . \nA new #Oxford study said that millions of people in the #UnitedKingdom (and therefore, in other countries) have likely already gotten the #coronavirus, recovered from it, and are immune. But the mainstream media doesn\u2019t want this information to get out, and some went to work quickly telling people \u201cnot to believe it.\u201d A newer model, which predicts the progression of the #novelcoronavirus, set off governments\u2019 reactions around the globe and has systematically ruined lives across the Western world (not because of the virus, but the reaction to it). pandemic produced by researchers at #ImperialCollegeLondon set off alarms across the world and was a major factor in several governments\u2019 decisions to lock things down. But a new model from #OxfordUniversity is challenging its accuracy, the Financial Times reports.\nThe head of the study, professor Sunetra Gupta, an Oxford theoretical epidemiologist, said she still supports the U.K.\u2019s decision to shut down the country to suppress the virus even if her research winds up being proven correct. But she also doesn\u2019t appear to be a big fan of the work done by the Imperial College team. \u201cI am surprised that there has been such unqualified acceptance of the Imperial model,\u201d she said.\nThe acceptance of the original model was to ensure people would be quickly living a life in fear and one without a source of income to combat the #totalitarian measures that have already been implemented and are still coming our way. Some media outlets say this newer model relies on assumptions so we should disregard it, yet the original model that has forced lockdown and an economic crash is relying on the same thing. Assuming no one has had the infection, and forcing everyone into a frenzied panic to prevent it.\nIf Gupta\u2019s work is accurate, that would likely mean a large swath of the population has already built up immunity to the virus and locking them down is pointless.\n.\n.\n.\n#dontbelievethelies #dontbelievethehype #bigthingshappening #backroundnoise #deepstate #hospital #filmyourhospital #clintons #distraction #hoax #corona #virus",
