I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness nor because I have any love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny, exploitation and oppression of my people by the whites. \n#NelsonMandela \nI just don't believe that when people are being unjustly oppressed that they should let someone else set rules for them by which they can come out from under that oppression. #MalcolmX \nREMEMBER WHEN THEY TELL YOU DO NOT BECOME WHAT YOU HATE. THATS THEM ADMITTING THEY KNOW HOW EVIL THEY ARE AND THEY WANT YOU TO DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. While the world only has to deal with the CORONAVIRUS. Black people still have to deal with #Racism and #PoliceBrutality. Smh The attack on our people never stops. \n#GeorgeFloyd\n#AhmaudArbery\n#SeanReed\n#BreonaTaylor \n#POPULATIONCONTROL \n#corona  #coronavirus  #Hr6666 #TraceAct #COVID19 #Shutdown #Martiallaw #quarantine  #pandemic #5G #Vaccination\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"\"fair use\"\" for purposes such as criticism. commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
