    "description": "The Bulgarian Pathology Association published a paper concluding that PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2, yet these are the tests used to determine case numbers and death statistics to justify lockdowns, masks, social distancing, contact tracing, and more. \n\nKary Mullis, the inventor of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology, said PCR is inappropriate to detect a viral infection. \n\nFurthermore, researchers have failed to prove that the virus is even a novel virus. The \u201cvirus\u201d has never even been isolated, purified or visualized. \n\nThe significance of this is that the government mandate to\u201d test-test-test\u201d has only one purpose, and it is not to detect \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, or rather, exosomal response markers to cell erosion. \n\nIt is to produce statistics for a bogus second wave. \n\nFull article:\n\nhttps://bpa-pathology.com/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\nRepost @the_orgonizedearth\n\n#covid1984 #orderoutofchaos #kill5G #mandatoryvaccinations #chaosbydesign #operationmockingbird #fight5G #eugenics #contacttracing #maskhole #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #transhumanistagenda #artificialintelligence #problemreactionsolution #scamdemic #conspiracyreality #covidiots #5G #geoengineering #climatechangehoax #wtc7 #soros #billgates #rothschild #rockefeller #depopulation #technocracy #electromagneticwaronhumanity",
