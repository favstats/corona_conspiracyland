    "description": "Medea - Media - the goddess of illusion ...\n-\nI think this explains a lot. The puppet masters love word magic/word play.... especially using the names of mythological gods/goddesses. By simply understanding etymology, the linguistical roots of language, and the correlation between certain words (that are usually powerful and present within modern language) we can find out and question the intention of these puppet masters.\n\nThe media creates an illusion that we then make a reality when our subconscious feeds on it. What we are seeing now is all an illusive game. Nothing has changed, problem reaction solution. Don\u2019t fall for the bait! Break the illusion by fully knowing that IT IS all an illusion. Take that as opportunity to develop self, your physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual self. This growth is ultimately all that matters! And if we collectively did this - wow what a change we shall experience together!\n\nFollow my personal \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd @itsazeem\n\u2014\n#covid19 #staywoke #nwo #virus #newworldorder #medialies #georgefloyd #pinealgland #wakeuppeople #truthseeker #thirdeye #wakeupsheeple #anonymous  #conscious #secretsocieties #mindcontrol #consciousawareness #politics #selfaware #freedomthinker #illuminati #truthseeker  #conscious #awareness #peoplepower #illusion #conspiracy #wakeup",
