This new world we\u2019re living in is totally okay! When ever you watch the news or see a commercial, they are making it like a harmonious proces. We don\u2019t need meetings ...we can do everything on a computer. The world cleaned up... even dolphins are swimming in the canals of Venice.\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fSchooling is going great with zoom ... the kids are loving it! \ud83e\udd28And although you can\u2019t see your loved ones you can Facetime them. The \u201cwe don\u2019t need to be together to be together\u201d slogan is annoying the hell out of me! \ud83e\udd2cEven writing this tekst I\u2019ve heard already 5 of those commercials.\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fSocial conditionings at it\u2019s finest?? Like I\u2019ve said in my previous posts people do need to be together. Children need interaction. They need to feel the hugs and love from their loved ones. And even for the adults it\u2019s necessary to be around other human beings. We need that social interaction and not just through a computer. We\u2019re not robots nor shall we ever be! We\u2019re all humans and going through this process in a different way... but I do feel like we\u2019re being led in a certain direction. Normalizing something that is abnormal doesn\u2019t seem right to me. And now drones are flying above our heads and telling us to stay further apart from each other, parks are full of police patrolling, some people in the supermarket think others are radioactive, Singapore wants to jail people for 6 months for standing to close to other humans. That just doesn\u2019t sound harmonious to me. Feels more like a divide and conquer situation. And you don\u2019t have to explain me why we\u2019re all doing it...I know...\ud83d\ude0f but some things still don\u2019t feel right to me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f #whatsnext \u2753\u2753 \u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063\n#speakup #truthseeker #draintheswamp  #pizzagate #saynotobillgates #nonewnormal #qanon #truthfreedomhealth #billgates #5g #stop5g #antivax #cabal #who #standthefuckup #id2020 #quarantine #covid19 #rebelonaroll \u2063",
