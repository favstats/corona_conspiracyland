    "description": "The whole \u201cpandemic\u201d is based on the \u201cgerm theory\u201d of disease & scientific fraud. \n\nThe creator of the \u201cgerm theory\u201d Louis Pasteur recanted on his death bed, saying \u201cthe germ is nothing, terrain is everything.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cvirus\u201c that they created a whole fear campaign around has never been isolated, purified or visualized. \n\nUnder the microscope it looks identical to what our body does when it has diseased/damaged cells- these are called \u201cExosomes\u201d. \n\nThe cells\u2019 way of communicating to other cells that there is damage occurring- an exosomal response marker.\n\nThis \u201cdamage\u201d can be from RF microwave radiation (5G), air pollution, VACCINES, stress, FEAR, shitty (acid/mucus forming) diet, overall toxicity. \n\nThe \u201cvirus\u201d they are telling you to fear is the \u201cresult\u201d, not the \u201ccause\u201d of illness. \n\nThe fear & panic will make the masses more likely to accept mandated vaccines- which WILL fuck you up, along with the higher frequencies of 5G. \n\nThey had to devise a plan to get the mASSES go accept mandating vaccines for the entire planet. Without a worldwide \u201cproblem\u201d, there would be no \u201creaction\u201d, and thus their \u201csolution\u201d (\ud83d\udc89) would not carry as much importance, viability or blind acceptance- reluctant or not.  They had to find a way to sway those on the fence who are learning more about #thetruthaboutvaccines - oh my bad, I forgot that tag has been censored\ud83e\udd2b.\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#covid1984 #orderoutofchaos #kill5G #mandatoryvaccinations #chaosbydesign #operationmockingbird #fight5G #eugenics #contacttracing #maskhole #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #transhumanistagenda #artificialintelligence #problemreactionsolution #scamdemic #conspiracyreality #covidiots #5G #geoengineering #climatechangehoax #wtc7 #soros #billgates #rothschild #rockefeller #depopulation #technocracy",
