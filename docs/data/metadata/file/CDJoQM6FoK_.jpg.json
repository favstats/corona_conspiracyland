    "description": "The thing is ... I\u2019m not against vaccines ... I just believe it should be your own choice. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to get one .. or feel like you have no other option.\ud83d\ude44To be honest this week I feel extremely irritated on Capri ... because of the temperature checks in every single place ... or my contact info that I have to leave behind. You can think well who cares ... it just takes a couple of minutes. \ud83e\udd28 But do you realize that I\u2019m not allowed to get in if I don\u2019t? I\u2019m not allowed to go out for dinner? To a beach club? Go in a airplane? They decide what I need to do ... And for those people who think well you should have stayed home then ... Well you\u2019re really missing the point \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udd2b A sales-girl or a waiter is checking my \u201chealth\u201d .... Do you realize how ridiculous this is?? My health was a private thing and 2020 has made that a public thing ... doesn\u2019t that worry you? Or you just don\u2019t care? I\u2019ve said it before and I will keep saying it over and over again... it\u2019s now the mask, the temperature check or your personal data that\u2019s necessary if you want to be part of a community ... And everybody accepts it ... or even worse they are truly enforcing it. Next it will be the vaccine ... and it won\u2019t my choice ... But I will be forced because of your acceptance ... because of your silence ... or even worse your indifference ... You don\u2019t have to agree with me ... but what you do need to realize is that forcing everybody to do the same means losing your freedom ... And keep in mind that what will come after the vaccine will probably not be your choice either ... \u270c\ufe0f\n\n\u2063 \u2063\n\u2063 \u2063 \u2063 \u2063\n\u2063 \u2063 \u2063\n\n#speakup #truthseeker #plandemic  #nonewnormal #freedom #summerday #wwg1wga  #italiandays #capri  #brunettesdoitbetter #saynotobillgates #bikinigirl #masksareforidiots #scamdemic #mommyandme #zegneetegenanderhalvemeter #standthefuckup  #covid19 #rebelonaroll",
