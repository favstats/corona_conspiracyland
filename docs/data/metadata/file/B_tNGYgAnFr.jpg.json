    "description": "Life is an adventure. It can be a wonderful adventure for some or an awful adventure for many but it's an adventure nonetheless. In a society that has destroyed all adventure, the only adventure left is to destroy that society. The banking elites have ordered you through their puppet politicians to cover up your face with a mask and your hands with rubber and you obediently conformed to their orders like a cowardly slave. Shame on you if you did. You let a hyped-up lab-made flu enslave you and you allowed the TV to terrorize you. Isn't it ironic that millions of people around the globe love movies that celebrate rebellion and cheer for disobedient underdogs who resist their political oppressors but yet they proudly vote, pay taxes and obey whatever rules are violently forced on them without ever questioning authority? We live in a world where people's understanding of the law is obedience through the threat of violence. But laws are mere ideas, and if you need violence to enforce your ideas, your ideas are worthless. \n#Plandemic #ID2020 #MarkOfTheBeast #DigitalID #UNICEF #WHO #MedicalMartialLaw #MedicalMartialLaw2020 #MartialLaw #MartialLaw2020 #BillGates #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #NWO #NewWorldOrder #COVID19 #COVID19Bioweapon #Coronavirus #COVID19Lockdown #BiologicalWeapons #WuhanCoronavirus #WuhanVirus \nSources:\nhttps://is.gd/TKN1m0\nhttps://is.gd/6zGPP0",
