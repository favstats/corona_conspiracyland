    "description": "New drone video shows a giant trench being dug at New York City's public cemetery on Hart Island to help handle an influx of unclaimed bodies due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe seaside of the\u00a0Long Island Sound\u00a0is home to many mysterious locations, and Hart Island is at the center of one of its darkest untold stories. Hart Island, sometimes referred to as Hart\u2019s Island, is a thin, half-mile long strip of land at the western end of the Long Island Sound which serves as a mass grave for\u00a0New York City, and is the largest mass grave site in the United States.\u00a0 This gravesite is known as a potter\u2019s field, because it is a common, tax-funded gravesite used for burying an area\u2019s unidentified or unclaimed bodies.\u00a0 Over 900,000 bodies were interred at Hart Island since 1869 \u2013 most of those being individuals who were homeless or unclaimed residents of New York City, or infants whose parents could not afford a burial.\nThroughout its history, the 130-acre island has been used as a prison camp for thousands of Confederate soldiers, a workhouse, a women\u2019s asylum, a sanatorium, and a Nike missile site during the Cold War. Since its start as a prison camp, people began using the island to bury the unknown or unclaimed en masse. To this day, Riker\u2019s Island inmates still inter 1,500 unclaimed bodies on the southern portion of the island every year.\nFrom 1980 to 2011, daily burials were conducted at the gravesite by prisoners from Riker\u2019s Island, who were paid 50 cents an hour to dig graves and stack wooden boxes in groups of 150 adults and 1,000 infants.\u00a0 The prisoners were also the only ones to leave memorials at Hart Island, including crosses made of twigs and small offerings of fruit or candy.\n#JesusIsComing #SignsOfTheTimes #PredictiveProgramming #Health #Tukkit #Future #Bronx #MartialLaw #NewYork #Praise #Virus #NYC #FalseFlag #Truth #WakeUp #OpenYourEyes #StayHome #Quarantine #COVid_19 #NewWorldOrder #MarkOfTheBeast #Awakening #Drone #WakeUp #EndTimes #Rikers #Prepare #PottersField",
