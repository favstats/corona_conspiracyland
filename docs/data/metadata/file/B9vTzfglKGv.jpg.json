    "description": "A photographer captured an incredible video of the famous Brazilian statue, Christ the Redeemer this week. Why was it incredible? Mila, who captured the video was 7,000 miles away from Rio, filming off the coast of San Francisco. \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"This is actually the Farallon Islands lighthouse west of San Francisco,\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" says Mila. \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"It was shape-shifted by the Fata Morgana.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" A Fata Morgana is a complex form of superior mirage that is seen in a narrow band right above the horizon. It is an Italian term named after the Arthurian sorceress Morgan le Fay, from a belief that these mirages, often seen in the Strait of Messina, were fairy castles in the air or false land created by her witchcraft to lure sailors to their deaths.\nFata Morgana mirages significantly distort the object or objects on which they are based, often such that the object is completely unrecognizable. A Fata Morgana may be seen on land or at sea, in polar regions, or in deserts. It may involve almost any kind of distant object, including boats, islands, and the coastline. Often, Fata Morgana changes rapidly. The mirage comprises several inverted (upside down) and erect (right side up) images that are stacked on top of one another. Fata Morgana mirages also show alternating compressed and stretched zones.\n#JesusIsComingSoon #Repent #EndOfTheWorld #EndTimes #AreYouReady #Tukkit #SignsOfTheTimes #SpiritualWarfare #ClimateChange #Apocalypse #JesusSaves #CurrentSituation #Tornado #COVid19 #China #Flood #Prophecy #Prepper #Brazil #LastDays #MarkOfTheBeast #ChristTheRedeemer #NewWorldOrder #Rio",
