The only thing is, according to astronomers there was no lunar eclipse on April 12, 2020.\nThe total lunar eclipses for 2020 are January 10-11 and June 5-6. There will be prenumbal or partial lunar eclipses on July 4-5 and November 29-30.\nSo astronomically, what many saw . . . was impossible.\nFriends report that the skies at Rome today and yesterday were both clear, and there are no wild fires burning to the East of Rome, so meteorologically it is hard to explain.\n#JesusIsComingSoon #Repent #EndOfTheWorld #EndTimes #AreYouReady #Tukkit #SignsOfTheTimes #SpiritualWarfare #HeIsRisen #ResurrectionSunday #ClimateChange #BloodMoon #JesusSaves #Animals #Exodus #CurrentSituation #Yolo #Covid_19 #UK #Locusts #Prophecy #Prepper #Passover #LastDays #MarkOfTheBeast #MiddleEast #NewWorldOrder #Rome",
