I ask you, leader (of parliament), to be our spokesperson who will give advice to President Conte: Next time you receive a phone call from the \u201cphilanthropist\u201d Bill Gates, forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. \u201cIf you won\u2019t do this for us, tell us how we should define you, the \u2018friendly lawyer\u2019 who takes orders from a criminal,\u201d said Cunial.\n\nThe Italian member of parliament is not the first person to accuse Gates of being unfit to dictate world health policy.\n\nAccording to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Bill Gates \u201clanded the job of dictating world health policy with no election, no appointment, no oversight and no accountability\u201d and he is demanding to know how and why this happened, adding \u201cDoes anybody else think this is creepy?\u201c Last month Robert F. Kennedy Jr. slammed Bill Gates and his \u201cmessianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology.\u201d \u201cVaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feed his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft\u2019s ambition to control a global vac ID enterprise) and give him dictatorial control over global health policy\u2014the spear tip of corporate neo-imperialism,\u201d Kennedy Jr. wrote. \u201cGates\u2019 obsession with vaccines seems fueled by a messianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology and a god-like willingness to experiment with the lives of lesser humans.\u201d\n. .....\n#coronavirus #covid19 #chinesevirus #chinaliedpeopledied #billgates #billgatesfoundation #thesepeoplearesick",
