Ultimately you're wishing and hoping people in power do have your best interests at heart, & that's fine.\nBut stop acting like you know it all because you've been educated by FOR PROFIT schools, funded by FOR PROFIT Billionaires and function under a historically immoral, unjust, downright insane, & FOR PROFIT Goverment. \n#nwo\n#billgates\n#vaccines\n#quarantine\n#socialdistancing\n#covid_19 \n#covid\n#5g \n#filmyourhospital \n#freedomofspeech \n#restinpeacetothefallen\n#prayfortheliving\n#read\n#meditate \n#believeinlove\nFollow @sageism",
