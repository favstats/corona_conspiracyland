    "description": "This is the Economist magazine published late last year for 2020. As they're always \"\"predicting\"\" you can see what plans they have for this year. I have found few words. There is a cryptocurrency trend with \"\"BTC\"\" as in Bitcoin and \"\"ETH\"\" as in Ethereum. Obviously they want cryptocurrency to be the only form of \"\"money\"\" we have. You can also see \"\"war\"\" \"\"die\"\" and \"\"oven\"\" which is not exactly a good thing. \n\nShare if you can find other words or see other clues in there! \n\nRepost @holistic.nomad\n\n#covi\u0307d19 #coronavirus #corruption #newworldorder #plannedemic #scamdemic #masks #maskscovid19 #propaganda #fakemedia #fakenews #newworldorder #populationcontrol #depopulation #agenda21 #agenda30 #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #corruption #corruptgovernment #crossword #crosswordpuzzle",
