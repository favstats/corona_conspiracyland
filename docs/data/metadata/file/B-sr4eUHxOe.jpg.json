    "description": "There's an incredible amount of aluminum humans are exposed to. We can find aluminum mostly in processed foods. Here's a list of items that are likely to contain aluminum:\nTobacco, antiperspirants, teas, breads, pastry and cheese, canned pop, baby formula, aluminum containers and foil, vaccines and chemtrails. Tap water also contains aluminum and flouride, and if you didn't know flouride actually causes us to absorb even MORE aluminum.\n\nAre you starting to see why it's important to them that we get heavy doses of aluminum? #EMF #gwentowers #highfrequencyradiowaves #mindcontrol #markofthebeast #antichristsystem #youcantstopthetruth #wakeupsheeple #aluminum #heavymetals #chemtrails #vaccines #coronavirus #5g",
