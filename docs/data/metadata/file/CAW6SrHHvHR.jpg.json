    "description": "@pushing_black\n---\nOn May 12, Brandon Kidd B went live after he was pulled over by Oklahoma State Patrol for speeding. Instead of the normal routine of walking up to the vehicle, talking to the driver, and issuing the ticket, these cops decided they needed #BrandonKiddB to exit his vehicle and approach the cop cars. A whole gang of cops approached and pulled their guns on Kidd in a stressful exchange, that, at any moment, could have resulted in the murder of Kidd. At a particularly dangerous moment, different officers shouted contradictory commands, while their guns were trained on Kidd. Thankfully, Kidd did a fantastic job staying calm and soothing the excitable nerves of trigger-happy cops. This kind of behavior is unnecessary, displays racial profiling, and is incredibly dangerous. We are grateful that Kidd survived without being brutalized, deprived of his freedom, or murdered.\n\u2022\nIG - @brandon_kidd_b\nFB - /brandon.kiddb\n#irunwithahmaud #IRunWithMaud\n#AhmaudArbery #Joggingwhileblack\n#SeanReed\n#BreonaTaylor \nWhile the world only has to deal with the CORONAVIRUS.
