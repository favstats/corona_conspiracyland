Xu was placed under house arrest, cut off from the internet, and scrubbed from all social media sites,\u00a0The Guardian reported.\nHis critique came three days after Wuhan doctor\u00a0Li Wenliang died\u00a0of the coronavirus. Li had sent a message to a group of medical school alumni, warning them about a mysterious new illness. But local police reprimanded and silenced him.\n.\n.\n.\n#coronavirus #corona #virus #pandemic #vaccine #vaccineagenda #globalpandemic #who #worldhealthorganization #populationcontrol #depopulation #billgates #billandmalindagatesfoundation #africa #sterilization #wuhan #china #vaccines #hoax #corona #deankoontz #wuhan #2020 #plague #event201 #genocide #drlieber",
