    "description": "Del Bigtree, host of the popular HighWire alternative-health news show, interviews Dr. Andrew Kaufman, who- like many other doctors & scientists are saying- says no one has ever used standard scientific methods to prove that a novel virus, known as SARS-CoV-2, even exists, and that, even if it does exist, there is no proof that it is responsible for the illnesses and deaths attributed to it. \n\nThese concepts might sound foreign if you rely on the corporate pharma cartel mainstream\nmedia for your information, and if you\u2019ve never heard of the \u201cTerrain Theory\u201d of disease.\n\nThe Rockefeller-funded Allopathic medical system only teaches & subscribes to the \u201cGerm Theory\u201d, which is just a theory & not factual, and in the case of Covid19, is based on fraudulent, ineffective & inapplicable testing methods.\n\nOnce you hear what Dr. Kaufman has to say, you will be amazed at the evidence to support the Terrain Theory of disease. \n\nIf true, all the lockdowns and masks and social distancing and ventilators and loss of employment and crushing of economies is totally unnecessary. \n\nDel Bigtree asks: If viruses are not the cause of illnesses, then why are they planning to force an anti-viral (DNA- modifying) vaccine on everyone? \n\nPlease listen carefully to Dr. Kaufman\u2019s response to that question. \n\n\u2022\n\nhttps://www.andrewkaufmanmd.com/\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#terraintheory #exosomes #covid1984 #orderoutofchaos #mandatoryvaccinations #chaosbydesign\n#fight5G #eugenics #contacttracing #maskhole #coronavirus #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #transhumanistagenda #artificialintelligence #problemreactionsolution #scamdemic #conspiracyreality #covidiots #5G #geoengineering #climatechangehoax #wtc7 #soros #billgates #rothschild #rockefeller #depopulation #technocracy",
