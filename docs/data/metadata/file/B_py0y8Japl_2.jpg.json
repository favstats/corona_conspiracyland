    "description": "This is from Bill Gates blog. He wants newborn babies, well, basically everyone on the planet to get the CV vax, which is being fast tracked, animal testing skipped, with nano bio-trackers and no liability. Even pro vaccine doctors like #PaulOffit and #PeterHotez have been sounding the alarm about this. It usually takes a minimum of 20 years to properly research and develop a vaccine. Offit\u2019s rotovirus vaccine, which is on the immunization schedule took 20 years to develop. The mumps vaccine used today was the shortest to date; seven years. Fast tracking a vaccine in 18 mos is unheard of and risky. .\n.\n@gavinnewsom @nygovcuomo are you following the science? Or, are you blinded by Gates and Fauci and their predictive models? If it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s time to get back into reality! Your \u201cnew normal\u201d is no where near my normal. Millions of Americans who live in your states feel the same way. There is more of us and a few of you! .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nhttps://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/What-you-need-to-know-about-the-COVID-19-vaccine?WT.mc_id=20200430100000_COVID-19-vaccine_BG-YT_&WT.tsrc=BGYT\n.\n\n#newnormal #stayathome #saynotobillgates #fuckbillgates #id2020 #billgatesisevil #firefauci #event201 #pandemic #scamdemic #coronavirus #covid19 #medicalfreedom #informedconsent #holistichealing #healthybaby #wakeupamerica #wakeup #reopencalifornia #vaccines #wwg1wga #backtowork #reopenamerica #1a #2a #crimesagainsthumanity #darktolight #unitednotdivided",
