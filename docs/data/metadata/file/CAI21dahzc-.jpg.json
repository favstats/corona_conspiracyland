During colder months, exosomes must purge more of these toxins than in warmer months, which may account for the seasonal nature of the flu. \u2022\n\nExosomes look exactly like viruses and behave exactly like them as well. However, the old theory views their association with toxic particles as evidence they are bad, while the new theory views their association with toxic particles as evidence they are good. \u2022\n\nThe debate is on, but there is a growing understanding among scientists that viruses and exosomes are one-in-the-same. \u2022\n\nFull vid:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/V1Im7jsW9_Y \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#mandatoryvaccinations #fight5G #orderoutofchaos #chaosbydesign #coronavirus #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #martiallaw #covid19 #plandemic #problemreactionsolution #conspiracyreality #covidiots #endthelockdown\n#5G #chemtrails\n#climatechangehoax #wtc7 \n#soros #billgates #rothschild #zionists #rockefeller #depopulation #eugenics #technocracy #smartcities #kill5G  #electromagneticwaronhumanity",
