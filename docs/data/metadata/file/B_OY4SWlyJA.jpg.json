For the love of god stop what your doing and read the book published in 1949! By George Orwell titled 1984 , the dystopian world he is speaking of we are living in now. \nTo the people of NY please know this is no disrespect when I say this but you must not trade your freedom under the guise of safety, this is exactly what happened with 911 and the patriot act that followed,  exchanging privacy for false security and once those doors open, just like the patriot act, it doesn't close back. .\n.\n#protests #wedonotconsent #open #reopenamerica #reopennyc #liberate #reopencalifornia  #reopen #tyranny \n#givemelibertyorgivemedeath #endthelockdown #sacramentoprotest\n#WeAreTheNewsNow #opencalifornia #openamerica #operationgridlock #londonrealarmy #stayathome #stayhome #noprotest #fightcovid19 #flattenthecurve",
