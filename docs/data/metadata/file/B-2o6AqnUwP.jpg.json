Cover your cell phone in tin foil and call it. You laughed at the chinese but it turns out the joke's on you!\n\nIt's a scientific fact that 5G electromagnetic frequency causes all kinds of ailments. It's not a conspiracy theory folks. How's your headache?  Are you aware of that 5G is known to weaken the immune system, cause heart palpitations, insomnia, leukaemia especially in children and so much more!? Do your research!... Or follow along like a sheep..and question nothing.\n\n5G has been banned in France, Belgium,  halted in Sweden and a global petition has been signed by thousands of scientists in 42 different countries stating that 5G is carcinogenic to all life on Earth! \nJust a conspiracy theory lol  you better just keep your head in the sand and trust your government ...they only have a lengthy history of killing, experimenting, manipulating and profiting of of their own people.\n\n#WAKEUP\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.#corruption #jFKJr #conciousness #qanonarmy #drchristinenorthrup #drmarkhyman #droz #NURSE #drmike #911insidejob #covid #trump #projectbluebeam #wwg1wga #godwins #cancer #cancersucks #5g",
