This in turn makes us sick and then we pay huge amounts of money when we get sick from using sunscreen all the time. A 2004 medical journal study actually showed that people who work indoors were twice as likely to get skin cancer as opposed to people who worked outdoors and received sunlight daily.\nNot getting enough sun leads to low vitamin D levels which then leads to a whole world of health problems.\n\u2600\ufe0f\nAnd the next subject for this post is sunburn. Sunburn occurs because our body is in a toxic state and our skin is filled with mucus. \nFor someone who eats mainly plant-based foods, they will surely notice that they do not get sunburnt easily if at all. They can be in the blistering sun for hours and will not get burned. \nMeat/dairy are highly acidic mucus forming foods which help to weaken the entire body and the skin which leads to sunburn when being out in the sun. \nRid those foods immediately!\nUse coconut oil for a sunscreen instead!\n#thegreatawakening #Qanon #QWEB #QMAP #WWG1WGA #followthewhiterabbit #redpill #conspiracy #truther #EarthAlliance #thestorm #draintheswamp #maga #5G #SpaceForce #COVID19 \u202a#CORONAVIRUS #QUARENTINE #5Grollout\u202c #ufo #alien #viral #mars #5deathgrid #sun #earth #killbillgates #ufosighting #reptilianshapeshifters",
