    "description": "This thread is a study in madness because the logic on testing does not make sense. \u2063\n\u2063\nFirst the WHO said asymptomatic transmission was rare citing studies....then they walked it back. \u2063\n\u2063\nHow do you walk that back? \n\u2063\nThe only possible way it DOES make sense is if you factor in very flawed testing, sheltering at home & mask mandates all being done as a crutch just to get us to a vaccine. \u2063\n\u2063\nThen it \u201cmakes sense\u201d I suppose to have shitty, unreliable testing that would need to get done all the time you\u2019re just doing that waiting to get a vaccine to save you in the end. \u2063\n\u2063\nYet those of us awake to vaccines & the fact that we don\u2019t have even one RNA virus on the books, the virus has mutated multiple times and the AVERAGE length to develop a vaccine is 6 years. It\u2019s been 4 months. \u2063We see the insanity. \n\u2063\nI mean, honestly I\u2019m not even sure what to say at this point the logic is so flawed in so many & the delusion is so great. \n#Repost @ali.zeck\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n#KnowYourEnemy #Agenda21 #NWO #HungerGamesSociety #FakeNews #FakeVirus  #ArrestBillGates  #Depopulation #PredictiveProgramming #FuckCelebrities\n #FuckVaccines  #GMOsArePoison #5GKillGrid #RFIDchips #Covid-19 #CoronaVirus",
