(KGET) \u2014 Doctors, scientists and government officials across the world have encouraged \u2014 even ordered \u2014 people to stay home to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nNow, two doctors in Kern County are sharing a differing opinion. They say sheltering in place is doing more harm than good.\n\nDoctors Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi of Accelerated Urgent Care refuse to wear masks outside. They say the longer people stay inside, the more their immune system drops.\n\nThey\u2019re calling for Kern County to reopen immediately. \u201cIf you have no symptoms, you should be able to return to work,\u201d Erickson said Wednesday. \u201cAre you an asymptomatic viral shedder? Maybe. But we can\u2019t test all of humanity \u2026 the major events, the sporting events, these are nonessential. Let\u2019s get back to those slowly. Let\u2019s start with schools.\u201d https://www.kget.com/health/coronavirus/doctors-provide-differing-opinion-on-shelter-in-place-order/\n\n#wedonotconsent #covid19 #covid #coronavirus #endthelockdown #freedom #nomandates #nomandatescanada #informedconsent #notobillgates #saynotobillgates #stopid2020 #reopencanada #nonewnormal #truth \n#reopencanqda #vaccinechoicecanada",
