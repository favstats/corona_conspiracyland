    "description": "#BillGates has inserted himself into the national dialogue as a self-proclaimed #coronavirus sage who will lead the world out of dark times through a digitally-assisted brave new world of testing, #contacttracing, and of course \u2013 a vaccine.\n\nOf course, some of this might not be such a bad idea if it wasn\u2019t coming from Gates, who\u2019s written an op-ed in the Washington Post to elaborate on his thoughts \u2013 which makes the whole thing seem even more nefarious. \u2018Sure, my Dad was on the board of planed parenthood \u2013 an organization founded by a eugenecist, and yes, I\u2019ve talked about the need for population reduction for years. And sure, I want you to take my vaccines and get chipped. And ok, maybe India kicked us out after our immunization campaign was blamed for paralyzing 490,000 kids. And yeah, there was that whole \u2018coronavirus pandemic\u2018 simulation my foundation spearheaded late last year which modeled 65 million dead. BUT, hear me out\u2026\u2018 All jokes aside, here\u2019s what Gates proposes in his WaPo Op-Ed in order to \u2018reopen the economy.\u2019 Widespread, at-home testing \u2013 \u201cWe can\u2019t defeat an enemy if we don\u2019t know where it is,\u201d says Gates, who advocates home testing kits which \u201cproduces results that are just as accurate\u201d as nasal swabs performed by healthcare professionals. Ok, not evil. Probably a good idea.\n\nChoosing who to test \u2013 Essential workers and symptomatic people, or those who have been in contact with someone who tested positive, should be prioritized, otherwise \u201cwe\u2019re wasting a precious resources and potentially missing big reserves of the virus.\u201d Asymptomatic people who aren\u2019t in the above categories should not be tested until there are enough tests, according to Gates. Again, not a terrible idea.\n\nUsing technology to enable a surveillance state \u2013 ah, here we go. Gates says the #UnitedStates needs to follow #Germany\u2019s example; \u201cinterview everyone who has tested positive and use a database to ensure someone follows up with all their contacts.\u201d And how to ensure accuracy?
