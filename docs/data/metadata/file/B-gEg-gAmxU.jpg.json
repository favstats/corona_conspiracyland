With that being said there\u2019s a lot of videos floating around the internet with people using radiation meters testing levels near the 5g towers. The results are extremely high. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nThe bill, which was passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives earlier this year, requires Trump to create and implement a plan for adopting secure 5G technology in the U.S. and abroad. Its text states that Trump must consult with the heads of the FCC, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and several other agencies and submit to Congress a strategy for rolling out secure 5G within 180 days.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nIn a statement, the Energy and Commerce Committee, a bipartisan congressional committee, praised the new act, noting that the need for 5G is even more critical during the coronavirus crisis since millions of Americans are working and being schooled from home. \"\"We must prepare our networks for the 5G future and ensure federal agencies work together on a comprehensive plan to identify and address security risks in 5G and future wireless technologies,\"\" the statement read. \"\"The Secure 5G and Beyond Act requires exactly that.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n#SIGNin tell us what you think. \nComment.
