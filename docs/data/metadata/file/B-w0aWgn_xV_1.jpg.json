This song is fully composed, written and all instruments are played by my mega talented husband @johnambrosefuzz. I just sing haha. We have a very important message to share so please go check it out, it\u2019s *F R E E* at bandcamp. It comes with a lyric sheet and a coloring page as well! Donations accepted.
