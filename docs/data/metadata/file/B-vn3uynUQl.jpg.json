    "description": "To determine if this EMF shielding fabric works, first I used my intuition. \u2063\n\u2063\nI put the sweater on for the first time last night, the fabric feels cool and silky. I immediately felt a physical sigh of relief as soon as I put it on, I even slept in it all night - I never sleep in a sweater but I wanted to! \u2063\nWhen I woke up I didn't want to take it off, so I wore it all day and all night. \u2063\u2063\nMy friends noticed the sweater looked so comfortable and both commented on it. They also commented that my energy was really high. I had also noticed an increase in energy today. \u2063\n\u2063\nFinally, we tested the phones to see if the fabric actually blocks the cell signal AND IT DOES!!! \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\nWe tried multiple experiments with multiple phones and like magic the cell signal was immediately lost when we put it inside the sweater. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\nI imagine my organs - my heart are protected from EMF's when I am wearing this sweater and I can feel it!! \u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nI relaunched my website www.shamanminerals.com so that I can sell these sweaters and also EMF blocking underwear for Men (to protect their balls from the sterilizing effects of radiation). \u2063\u2063\nThe fabric is a mix of silver, cotton and nylon. This is the silver era! Silver is our ally in the battle against weaponized frequencies. \u2063\n\u2063\nWe are thinking about making baby blankets with the fabric, so if you have an interest in ordering one let me know so we can see if there is a demand! \u2063\n\u2063\nIf you want to support me you can purchase with the link in my bio! \u2063\u2063\nLove, Kaleigh \ud83d\ude4c\u2728\u2600\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc9b\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#emfprotection\n#5g\n#5gprotection \n#justasking\n#justaskingcampaign\n#coronahoax \n#covid19hoax \n#antiradiation \n#freeenergy\n#5d \n#wwg1wga \n#hollyweirdisevil\n#fuckbillgates\n#weaponizedfrequencies\n#coronamemes \n#corona\n#covid19 \n#health\n#healing\n#love",
