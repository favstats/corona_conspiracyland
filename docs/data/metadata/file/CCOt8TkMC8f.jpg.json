    "description": "An analysis of US mortality data by Mark Blaxill and Amy Becker shows that the weekly number of deaths among infants during the pandemic lockdown dropped by about 30%. \u201cStarting in early March, expected deaths began a sharp decline, from an expected level of around 700 deaths per week to well under 500 by mid\u2010April and throughout May.\u201d \n\nThe unexpected survival of 200 babies per week precisely corresponds with a drop in vaccination. A group of authors from the CDC and Kaiser Permanente reported in the May 15 issue of the CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report that there was a \u201csharp decline in provider orders for vaccines as well as a decline in pediatric vaccine doses administered.\u201d\n\nLower infant deaths associated with stopping vaccinations in babies also was noted by a doctor in Italy in a letter to Robert F. Kennedy of Children\u2019s Health Defense. Dr. Antonietta M. Gatti wrote that during the lockdown there were no sudden-infant-death syndromes. After the lockdown, baby vaccination started again, and there was a dead baby in Turin, and another child and two twins died.\n\n\u2022\n\nArticle: https://healthchoice.org/lessons-from-the-lockdown/\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#mandatoryvaccinations #fight5G #eugenics #orderoutofchaos #chaosbydesign #contacttracing #coronavirus #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #transhumanistagenda #artificialintelligence #covid1984  #problemreactionsolution #scamdemic #conspiracyreality #covidiots #5G #geoengineering #climatechangehoax #wtc7 #soros #billgates #rothschild #rockefeller #depopulation #technocracy #kill5G #electromagneticwaronhumanity",
