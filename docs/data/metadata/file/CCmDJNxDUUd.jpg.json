Experiments have shown that the \u00bd Hz sensory resonance can be excited in this manner in a subject near the monitor. The 2.4 Hz sensory resonance can also be excited in this fashion. Hence, a TV monitor or computer monitor can be used to manipulate the nervous system of nearby people.\u201d\n-\nI\u2019ll just leave it there.
