Time for this week\u2019s FREE \u2018Ratchet\u2019 \u2014 the downloadable hardtimes \u2018zine from the makers of The Road Rat.\n_\nIn this week\u2019s BIGGEST YET Ratchet we open up our pages to the design team over at Morgan (@morganmotors) who share with us just exactly what they\u2019ve been up to this last month of lockdown. It will surprise you. Maybe worry you (they reassure us they are all well and sleeping normally). But it will certainly entertain you.\n_\nBehind the covers are further tributes to Sir Stirling Moss from the likes of Peter Stevens (@peterstevensdesign)and Will Buxton (@wbuxtonofficial). There\u2019s also a disturbing report from the the world of endurance racing and team \u20185G Lizards\u2019, backed it seems by celebrated bull goose loony David Icke. \n_\nThere\u2019s booze from F1 ace Jarno Trulli (@jarnotrulliofficial) and food via Ferdinand Piech (thank you to @residenzheinzwinkler for that one). There\u2019s music, movies and stuff, frankly we can all leave behind once this is over.\n_\nPop over to theroadrat.com to download your free copy. Remember, if you can\u2019t be arsed to print and assemble it at home, it\u2019s the \u2018read me\u2019 option you will need to select. Otherwise go for \u2018print me\u2019 . \n_\nAll four issues of The Ratchet are available \u2014 as are all four editions of The Road Rat which are currently available to everyone at the subscriber\u2019s price of \u00a310.00 plus postage.\n_\nPlease don\u2019t drink any disinfectant or start believing a tanning session will make you immune. Listen to what the scientists say and keep following your local/national rules. KBO. \n_\nThe Road Rat. A Thing for Cars\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#TheRoadRat #AThingForCars #TheYearOfTheRat #TheRatchet\n#Morgan #Moss #StirlingMoss #DavidIcke #5GBollox\n#Covid19 #CoronaVirus #Pandemic #Lockdown\n#SuperCar #SuperCars #ClassicCar #ClassicCars \n#Instacar #Instacars #CarsOfInstagram #Classics \u2028#Art #Photography #Design #Magazine",
