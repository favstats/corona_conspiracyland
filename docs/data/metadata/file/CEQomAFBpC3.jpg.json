    "description": "I\u2019m tired of heading the doctor reasoning. Doctors don't wear cloth masks. Additionally, they don't wear surgical masks to keep from spreading colds. They do it to keep bacteria out of open wounds during surgery.\n.\n\nMost masks people wear just shift the viral load from going down (since most people breath out of their nose), to going up into their eyes and above their head. It catches a very small amount of actual vapor as the masks aren't permeable enough to force airflow through the mask with normal breathing. Also, if you sneeze with a mask on and you have the automatic reaction to bend your head down, now most of the mist goes in front of you rather than down.\n\nMasks don't work. They are about pushing people into a corner to and take away autonomy. Fear is always used to take away liberty. Just read the stuff the founding father wrote.\n.\n#q #wwg1wga\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb #nonewnormal #trump #electioninfection #election2020 #covid_19 #truth #truthseeker #weareinthistogether #wearethenewsnow #health #wellness #saynotobillgates #arrestbillgates #holisitichealth #healthykids  #keepkidssafe #kidsneedmore #medicalfreedomactivist #freedom",
