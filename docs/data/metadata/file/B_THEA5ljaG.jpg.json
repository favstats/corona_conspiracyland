    "description": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday he favors allowing states struggling with high public employee pension costs amid the burdens of the pandemic response to declare bankruptcy rather than giving them a federal bailout. \u201cI would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route,\u201d he said Wednesday in a response to a question on the syndicated Hugh Hewitt radio show. \u201cIt\u2019s saved some cities, and there\u2019s no good reason for it not to be available.\u201d The host cited California, Illinois and Connecticut as states that had given too much to public employee unions, and McConnell said he was reluctant to take on more debt for any rescue. \u201cMy guess is their first choice would be for the federal government to borrow money from future generations to send it down to them now so they don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to be in favor of.\u201d #JesusIsComing #SignsOfTheTimes #PredictiveProgramming #Heath #Tukkit #PoliceState #EconomicCollapse #MartialLaw #NewYork #CashlessSociety #Virus #EndTheFed #FalseFlag #Truth #WakeUp #OpenYourEyes #Bankruptcy #Quarantine #COVid_19 #NewWorldOrder #MarkOfTheBeast #Awakening #Rockefellercenter #WakeUp #EndTimes #ComingSoon #Prepare #Technology",
