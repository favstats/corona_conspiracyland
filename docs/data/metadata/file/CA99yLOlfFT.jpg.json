    "description": "#Repost  @naynay_greeneyez The Bible teaches us to place our hope in the return of Jesus who will come again in order that we can live with him forever. That is something that should truly give us hope.\nThis verse is the second to last verse in the whole Bible. John wrote the book of Revelation to Christians who were suffering from persecution, and these life giving words were intended to give them hope in the midst of their suffering. Just like them, as we anticipate the second coming of Christ, we too should take comfort in our future hope.\nThe Lord is coming again to make all things right and to give us eternal fellowship with Him in heaven. Praise G-d and thank Him for this hope. Ask the Lord to help you to trust Him when you suffer for His sake. Pray that you will always remember the Lord\u2019s promise to be with us and not to forsake us.\ud83d\udc51All praises to our King YESHUA!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc51\u25b6 YESHUA (JESUS) IS COMING\ud83d\udc51All praises to our King YESHUA!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc51: REPENT & BELIEVE THE GOSPEL..\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc95 #MartialLaw #coronavirus #covid_19 #bayarea#5g #sacramento#nyc #sanjose #sanfrancisco#oakland#modesto#HR6666 #fresno#losangeles#wakeup #sacramento #Yeshua #messianicjew #femacamps #endtimes#endtimesprophecy#persecution #greattribulation #Yeshua#repent #biblicalplague #markofthebeast #california",
