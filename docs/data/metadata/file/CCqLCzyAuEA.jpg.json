    "description": "Stockholm syndrome has been defined as a condition in which hostages develop a psychological alliance with their captors during captivity. Emotional bonds may be formed between captor and captives, during intimate time together, but these are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. Stockholm syndrome has never been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM, the standard tool for diagnostic of psychiatric illnesses and disorders, mainly due to the lack of a consistent body of academic research. The syndrome is extremely rare as noted by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation's Hostage Barricade Database System and Law Enforcement Bulletin estimating that fewer than 5% of kidnapping victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome. This term was first used by the media in 1973 when four hostages were taken during a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\n-Wikipedia\n\n#5G60gigahertz #aslongasthereisfreespeech #hiddeninplanesight #followthewhiterabbit #madworld #prisonplanet #newworldorder #1776 #agenda21 #agenda30 #event201 #covid_19 #5G #luciferian #worldwidelockdown #elite #government #wakeupsheeple #freedomthinker #illuminati #depopulation #eugenics #rfid #adrenochrome #georgiaguidestones #conspiracy #conscious #awareness #mindcontrol",
