    "description": "A petition to investigate Bill Gates for crimes against humanity and medical malpractice has gained a staggering 289,000 signatures from concerned citizens, almost tripling the number required to get a response from the White House. Because the petition is only 10 days old, it may hit half a million signatures. The WeThePeople petition, which can be signed by going to this site https://is.gd/jMPOTd, asks the federal government to investigate the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The petition was created on April 10 and it reached the threshold of 100,000 signatures within days. It is currently one of the most popular petitions on the site. This petition comes as change.org, which is funded by Bill Gates, eliminated a similar petition for the UK.\n\n#BillGates #Plandemic #ID2020 #MedicalMartialLaw #MedicalMartialLaw2020 #MartialLaw #MartialLaw2020 #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #NWO #NewWorldOrder #COVID19 #COVID19Bioweapon #Coronavirus #COVID19Lockdown #BiologicalWeapons #WuhanCoronavirus #WuhanVirus #Pandemic #PopulationControl #FamilyPlanning #SelfIsolation #NewNorm #BigBrother #ProblemReactionSolution #BillAndMelindaGatesFoundation #GatesFoundation #SayNoToBillGates\n\nSources:\nhttps://is.gd/Zg86Fa\nhttps://is.gd/jMPOTd",
