Police fired tear gas and water cannon at thousands of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters who gathered  against a controversial security law proposed by China, in the most intense clashes in months.\n\nThe planned legislation is expected to ban treason, subversion and sedition, and comes after Hong Kong was shaken last year by months of massive, often-violent protests, and repeated warnings from Beijing that it would not tolerate dissent.\n\nWith campaigners warning the proposal could spell the end of the city's treasured freedoms, thousands gathered in the busy Causeway Bay and Wan Chai districts, chanting slogans, as some masked protesters set up makeshift barricades to stop police vehicles.\n\n#Qanon #QWEB #QMAP #WWG1WGA #followthewhiterabbit #redpill #conspiracy #truther #EarthAlliance #thestorm #draintheswamp #maga #5G #SpaceForce #COVID19 \u202a#CORONAVIRUS #QUARENTINE #5Grollout\u202c #ufo #alien #viral #mars #moon #sun #earth #ufos #ufosighting #reptilianshapeshifters #worldprotests",
