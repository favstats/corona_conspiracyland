Information is at your finger tips. The time you spend entertaining yourself. Take an hour of that learning something you don\u2019t know. \nAsk the most important questions WHO WHAT WHERE WHY AND WHEN. \nNo one gives you information for nothing. Most times especially with our government. If they tell you one thing look around they are hiding something else. We need to be more informed as a people. The days of trusting any one are done. See it for yourself,  Hear it for yourself, Touch it for yourself, and then after that do research just to make sure you know it\u2019s true. We all have an agenda when we give information.
