    "description": "The WHO comes out and says that asymptomatic individuals really will spread COVID-19. Yet, the video gets tagged and marked by \u201cfact-checkers\u201d as not being true!  Really? You can hear this doctor from the world health organization clearly stating what we all know the WHO has said. But these idiot \u201cfact-checkers\u201d want you to believe that you cannot trust your own eyesight or your own hearing any more. Why? Because it inconveniently goes against the false narrative that they have been pushing along with the rest of the tech Giants and main stream media!\n\nListen to the short clip. Then listen to it again. And if you still don\u2019t fully grasp the implications, listen to it and watch it one more time. When dealing with this level of corruption and deception, change is inevitable and will come harshly from a public that will no longer tolerate lies and deceit.  Share this with those who STILL don\u2019t get it!\n\n#covid19 #covidconspiracy #corona #patriots #patriot #qanon #DrButtar #AHEADMAP #AdvancedMedicine #AdvancedMedicineConference #IADFW #Fitness #Longevity #livelonger #livehealthy #power #facts #knowledge #truth #empowerment #livefree #livefreeordie #populationcontrol #whistleblower #soldiers #wechangetheworld #healthfreedom #health #freedom #medicalfreedom",
