Black people still have to deal with #Racism and #PoliceBrutality. Smh The attack on our people never stops. \n#POPULATIONCONTROL \n#corona  #coronavirus  #COVID19 #Shutdown #Martiallaw #quarantine  #pandemic #5G #Vaccination\n#Coronachallege #coronamemes\n\nThere is a genocide going on in the black community. Our young children are going missing and we all know it\u2019s for organs and human trafficking. If they are not being kidnapped, our people are being killed, murdered by police and by people on the street who are protected by the police. If they dont  get us in the streets the court system is illegally and unjustly sending our black people away for LIFE SENTENCES. On every level we are being attacked. \nWhat hurts the most is if they don\u2019t get us on one of those three fronts. We are out here KILLING EACH OTHER. IT HAS TO STOP AND WE HAVE TO WAKE UP TO WHAT IS GOING ON.  They are playing chess with our lives not checkers. \nIf we don\u2019t start supporting our own and building our own communities . They will always control us and our CHILDREN. We will be leaving a situation worse than we are in NOW, for the Next GENERATION. Does that not scare YOU, it should? That our children may have to fight an even harder fight, than the one we are fighting right NOW. That our ignorance THE FACT WE CAN NOT STOP FIGHTING EACH OTHER will be the bullet that kills our children\u2019s future. Think about that for a second. History is repeating itself. Are we going to act like we don\u2019t see it ???? Until we unite and support our own. We must take responsibility for allowing them to do this to us.
