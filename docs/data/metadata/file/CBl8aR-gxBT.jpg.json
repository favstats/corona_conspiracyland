    "description": "Repost: @brujafromthebay\n\u2800\nThis video shows how @Google manipulates search results to dismiss conspiracy theories. The first results to appear when searching \u201c322 new cases of covid\u201d are articles from mainstream sources debunking the \u201c322 COVID conspiracy\u201d when the word \u201cconspiracy\u201d wasn\u2019t even typed in the search box. These are followed by example after example of news headlines that say \u201c322 new cases\u201d appearing across the US, giving credence to the conspiracy Google is trying to debunk.\n\u2800\nSo why 322? I won\u2019t pretend to understand the motives behind a phenomenon like this but I do know that another name for Skull & Bones, one of the three big secret societies at Yale, is Order 322. Perhaps they are hinting as to who is behind this false flag or it\u2019s an inside joke of sorts.\n\u2800\nWhat do you think?\n\u2800\n\u2800\n#billgates #billgatesisevil #billandmelissagatesfoundation #eugenics #depopulation #technocrats #pedophiles #technocracy #antilockdown #conspiracy #conspiracytheory #conspiracyfact #newworldorder #plandemic #scamdemic #pandemic #coronavirus #event201 #corruption #evil #agenda21 #wakeup #truth #civildisobedience #weneedarealrevolution",
