    "description": "Alabama cop violently slams a woman's head to the ground for not wearing a mask at Walmart! The video shows the cop placing the woman in handcuffs as she begins to walk away from him. The officer then grabs the woman, lifts her up, and drops her to the floor face-first! The incident started when the cop approached the woman for not wearing a mask and ended with punishing and enslaving her by using excessive violence against her under the full protection of the law before charging her with disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, third-degree criminal trespassing, possession of marijuana and unlawful possession of a controlled substance. Such incidents of police brutality against citizens happen routinely on a daily basis in the United Slaves of America. Cops exist to punish and enslave citizens. If you think cops exist to serve you, the taxpayer, then you're a true idiot. Cops don't serve the taxpaying working class. They serve the political class that serves the banking class. If cops are ordered to torture, they torture. If they're ordered to kill, they kill. If they're ordered to kidnap, they kidnap. If they're ordered to rape, they rape. And they'll do it all with pride and even demand respect for it. That's what the profession is all about. Following orders no matter what they may be. And these orders always come from the banking class through the political class that they puppeteer. \n#PoliceBrutality #PoliceSate #KillerCops #PoliceViolence ##Plandemic #ID2020 #MedicalMartialLaw #MedicalMartialLaw2020 #Event201 #NWO #NewWorldOrder #COVID19 #Coronavirus #COVID19Lockdown \nSources:\nhttps://is.gd/oEpt9Z\nhttps://is.gd/9MBXrS",
