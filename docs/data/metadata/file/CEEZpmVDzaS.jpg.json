    "description": "So many of us are here to connect with other people who can see through all the bullshit. People who aren\u2019t scared. People who want their freedom back.\n\nBut some people are scared. Some people don\u2019t care that the government is using the police to intimidate them into living small lives. What can you do?\n\nStay strong. Eat healthy. Exercise. And take a break from social media now and then. What use is being free if you\u2019re constantly glued to the phone or computer saying \u201cThis is unbelievable? Why can\u2019t everyone see what\u2019s going on? When will this end?\u201d\n\nGo for a walk. Be free. You might make someone jealous.\n\nIn a good way.\n\nLots of love,\n\nBen\n\n#freeyourselftherestwillfollow #freeVictoria #endthelockdown #endtheMelbourneLockdown #scamdemic #plandemic #covidisover #fluseason #mediaisthevirus #TVismindprogramming #Turnoffthetv #turnoffyourTV",
