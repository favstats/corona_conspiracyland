Comment below.\n__\nMonsters inc is a movie about monsters working in a scare factory.\n__\nExactly what is\u00a0#adrenochrome ?\u00a0In scientific terms, it is a chemical that is\u00a0produced\u00a0in the human body when adrenaline [also known as epinephrine] oxidizes.\n__\nThe elites super drug is harvested through the experience of terrifying individuals to the brink of fear/insanity\n__\nHow is the chemical extracted? A victim is terrorized,and usually tortured, thus increasing the amount of adrenaline that is flowing through their body.\u00a0\n___\nThey are then killed and the adrenochrome is collected with\u00a0a needle and syringe from the base of the back of their neck and spinal\u00a0column. Once collected, the chemical can be sold on the\u00a0black market at exorbitant prices.\n-\nRepost: @thoughtleaderz \ud83c\udfa5\n-\n\nFollow my persona \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd @itsazeem\n-\n#RESHARE #WEDONOTCONSENT #SAYNO \n#IDONOTCONSENT #TECHNOCRACY #DYSTOPIA #ORWELLIAN #THISISNOT1984 \n#truthseeker #truthseekers #truthisinplainsight #thetruthisstrangerthanfiction #thetruthwillsetyoufree #agenda2030 #woke #newworldorder #staywoke #covid19 #totalitarianism #illuminati #globalists #covid1984 #staytruetoyou #liveinyourpower #truthbetold",
