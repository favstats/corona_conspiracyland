    "description": "Recommended reading:\n\nMedical Apartheid by Harriet A. Washington traces the complex history of medical experimentation on Black Americans in the United States since the middle of the eighteenth century. Washington argues that \"\"diverse forms of racial discrimination have shaped both the relationship between white physicians and black patients and the attitude of the latter towards modern medicine in general\"\".\n\nThe book is divided into three parts: the first is about the cultural memory of medical experimentation; the second examines recent cases of medical abuse and research; while the last addresses the complex relationship between racism and medicine. Some topics discussed are well-known, such as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment (1932\u201472), in which African Americans with the disease were intentionally denied treatment (without being told) in order to allow the progression of the disease so it could be observed in all stages, but other episodes are less well known to the general public. The book also mentions cases of Medical experimentation in Africa and their links to African-American cases. \n\n#billgatesisevil #covid19 #medicalapartheid #protests #africansarehuman #not #medicallabrats #thevirus #racism #racismisthepandemic #pandemic #coronavirus #blacklivesmatter #blackbodies #africaisnotalab #nojusticenopeace #fuckyoubillgates #africaisnotyourplayground #colonizedminds #southafrica",
