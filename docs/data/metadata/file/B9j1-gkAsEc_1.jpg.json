    "description": "Now that we have talked about China's role in the Corona virus and what I believe the plan was all along in my last post .  Let us now talk about how the deep state is using this. The deep state knows that the virus is not as Bad as the media is stating that it is. \nThat is because they are the ones who own the media. The deep state is now actively trying to suppress things that are happening in the background that are starting to expose them on a much deeper level then even in the last 3 years.\n As people are beginning to buy out Costco of their toilet paper, toothbrushes  And other 1st world essentials. They turn a blind eye to the fact that 62000 people have recovered from the virus in China. Quarantines are being lifted and now even people over 80 are proving that you can beat the virus. \nSo what types of things are they trying to distract us from maybe the oil prices that have dropped to lower than we have seen in 20 years . Maybe the deposition of hillary clinton . The possible indictment of chucky Schumer.  The 100,000+ indicments that are just starting to be unsealed , the lawsuits against big corporations and vaccine companies . The scandals and involvement of top CEOs and big names being implicated in treason and pedophelia . \nThe list goes on and on and while everyone is distracted by this corona non sense the attention is. Ot being paid to all the events that are changing the world for the better . So this will be my last post for now on the topic of the corona virus so WE can help uncover some of the things that the deep state is trying so desperately to cover up . Stay hungry my friends \ud83c\udf5e\n.\n.\n.\n#coronavirus #corona #virus #pandemic #vaccine #vaccineagenda #globalpandemic #who #worldhealthorganization #populationcontrol #depopulation #billgates #billandmalindagatesfoundation #africa #sterilization #wuhan #china #vaccines #hoax #corona #deankoontz #wuhan #2020 #plague #event201 #genocide",
