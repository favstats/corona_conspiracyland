With all the information we get constantly changing, one thing I know for sure is that people are really getting sick and some go to the hospital never to return home. #covid19  is real. Please stay home when asked to. Wash ur hands as often as possible. Wear masks. Drink hot beverages. Gargle with salt water (to kill germs). Take multiple showers. Do whatever you can to stay alive not just for urself but for all those who love you. Who care about you. Who need you. And AGAIN - stay safe for those who\u2019s world would collapse if this disease took you from them.  I \u2764\ufe0f you!! #coronavirus #socialdistancing  #stayhome #keepyourheadup  #southsidewilliamsburg  #strongereveryday #billgatesisevil",
