    "description": "The doctor in Rand Paul took over for the questioning. He began by challenging Dr. Fauci on the media narrative that there is no evidence that patients who survive coronavirus have immunity. To be helpful Paul pointed out the following:\n\nIn experiments, rhesus monkeys infected with COVID-19 can\u2019t be reinfected\nStudies have shown plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients neutralizes the virus in lab experiments\nThe entire premise of convalescent plasma treatment, mentioned by several on the panel as a potential treatment currently in trials, is that recovered patients develop immunity capable of killing the virus\nRecovering patients across the board are showing significant antibody response\nWe know SARS and MERS, coronaviruses with similar clinical presentations, confer immunity for at least 2-3 years\n\nPaul then stated that his view is that the truth is the exact opposite of the media narrative. There is very good evidence that recovered patients will have some durable immunity. And recovered workers, in industries like meatpacking, should be reassured there is a strong likelihood they will not get reinfected. He then referenced that Dr. Fauci had said publicly that he would bet it all that survivors of COVID-19 have some form of immunity and asked him to set the record straight.\n\nhttps://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/stacey-lennox/2020/05/12/senator-rand-paul-questions-dr-fauci-drops-a-bomb-in-senate-hearing-n390185\n\n#wedonotconsent #covid19 #covid #coronavirus #endthelockdown #freedom #nomandates #nomandatescanada #informedconsent #notobillgates #saynotobillgates #stopid2020 #reopencanada #nonewnormal #truth \n#reopencanqda #vaccinechoicecanada",
