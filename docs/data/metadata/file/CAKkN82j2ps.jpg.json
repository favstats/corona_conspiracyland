    "description": "At a time when the world seemed to be crumbling, Charlie Chaplin provided a call to action to revive the state of humanity. Fast forward to 2020 and it\u2019s just as relatable today. By accessing a powerful delivery and a very stimulating emotional proposal, he effectively conjures up the deterioration of liberty and energizes his world audience to \u201cfight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance\u201d. He fully evokes his audience to stand against injustice and to unite together against the \u201cunnatural men\u201d, mainly the great dictator Hitler. He provides the world with a reason and avenue to better life for all. Are we listening or choosing to remain in a never ending coma? #thegreatawakening #motivationalspeech .\n.\n.\n.
