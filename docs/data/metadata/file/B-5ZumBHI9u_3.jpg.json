    "description": "So supposedly .. the new corona virus symptom that patients are describing are \u201cbuzzing\u201d \u201cfizzing\u201d or \u201cburning sensation\u201d throughout the body/skin.. can this get more obvious?! Or is it another coincidence? \ud83d\ude02 5G is what we really need to be focused on. Spreading awareness. Educating ourselves, family and friends. Sign petitions. Find ways to protect yourself (I\u2019ll post all about it).. the same way people are going out of their way paying extra money for hand sanitizer & gloves.. wearing mask & gloves outside, social distancing, quarantine.. put that same energy into protecting yourself from 5G.. I don\u2019t get how people could self isolate and freak out over this \u201cvirus\u201d but won\u2019t do a damn thing to protect themselves or their kids from 5G radiation?? Make it make sense.\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#coronavirus #covid19 #fakenews #news #media #hoax #5g #trump #cdc #qanon #humantrafficking #distraction #virus #sheeple #plandemic #pandemic #billgates #epidemic  #socialdistancing #billgates #id2020 #agenda21  #nwo #hiddenagenda #emfsensitivity #microwaveradiation #stop5g #5gkills",
