    "description": "Before the novel coronavirus struck the horn of Africa, countries already had a plague on their hands.\nToward the end of last year,\u00a0swarms of desert locusts\u00a0began flooding the region in numbers not seen in decades. Unusually wet weather over the previous 18 months created ideal breeding conditions for the insects. Since then, the swarms have multiplied across\u00a0ten countries\u00a0as continued rain during what is typically the dry season allowed each new wave of the insects to breed. The plague is\u00a0especially threatening\u00a0in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia. Desert locusts are voracious eaters who travel in swarms the size of cities and will devastate crops, pastures, and forests if they aren\u2019t controlled, posing a major threat to food security in countries where already\u00a020 million people are food-insecure.\nDespite the alarming numbers of swarms, they have not dramatically impacted the food supply yet, according to Cyril Ferrand, the East Africa resilience team leader for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). When the locusts arrived in full force in late December, farmers had already secured their seasonal harvest. \u201cOur concern is for the season to come,\u201d Ferrand told Grist. Farmers are beginning to plant now for the June/July harvest, just as a new generation of locusts are starting to mature. \u201cThere could be up to 100 percent losses,\u201d said Ferrand. \u201cThat\u2019s very clear.\u201d #JesusIsComingSoon #Repent #EndOfTheWorld #EndTimes #AreYouReady #Tukkit #SignsOfTheTimes #SpiritualWarfare #Eygypt #Pharaoh #ClimateChange #Africa #JesusSaves #Mecca #Exodus #CurrentSituation #Yolo #Covid_19 #China #Locusts #Prophecy #Prepper #Passover #LastDays #MarkOfTheBeast #MiddleEast #NewWorldOrder #SaudiArabia",
