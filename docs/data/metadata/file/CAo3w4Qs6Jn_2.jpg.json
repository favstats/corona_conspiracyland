    "description": "Memorial Day 2020, in front of Nobu LA on La Cienega Blvd, 2nd pic in front of The Ivy Restaurant and Chanel on Robertson Blvd.  Both streets are normally very high traffic streets.\n.\nWe\u2019re 71 days into a lockdown ghost town, thanks to our Nazi Democrat Governor Gruesome of LA County.\n.\nThis #FakePandemic is bankrupting people\u2019s lives, livelihood and businesses for our Democratic Governors political gain!\n.\nJust to clarify, I believe COVID-19 is real, and any death is tragic and horrible but I call it a Fake Pandemic because there are not enough deaths to have us closed down and on lockdown. The suicide rate is the highest since the last World War, spouse and child abuse at home has risen and people are loosing everything they\u2019ve worked their entire lives for.\n.\nAssholes will be blocked.\n.\n#SaveCalifornia #RecallNewsom #FireNewsom #ArrestBillGates #ArrestFauci #covidhoax2020 #overlockdown #opencalifornia #quarantine #plandemic",
