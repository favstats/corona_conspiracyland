    "description": "\"\"Hi, Im from the Government, Im here to help\"\".... How does the Cannabis Community of all oppressed groups of people not realize that the government is not your friend... they don't care about you.. We have to understand who we are and where we fit in the natural order of the world because our oppressor deals in illusions. They tell us that it is power, but it is\u00a0not\u00a0power. They may have all the guns and they may have all the racist laws and judges, and they may control all the money, but that is not power. These are imitations of power and they are only \u2018power\u2019 because in our minds we allow it to be power. \ufffc\n\nOur obligations and loyalty should not be to a government that has proven time and time again that it is the enemy of the people unless the people are rich in dollars. ... The Earth gives us life, not the American government. The earth gives us life, not the multi-national corporate government. The Earth gives us life. We need to have the Earth. We must have it, otherwise our life will be no more. So we must resist what they do.\n#JohnTrudell\u00a0\nhttps://youtu.be/0Stuvm2pFkk\n#Plandemic\n#Obey\n#plandemic2020 \n#controlthesheep\n#ObeyIsTheNewNorm\n#5G\n#GMO\n#CoronaVirus #reefer\n#Vaccines\n#cannabiscommunity\n#pandemic2020 \n#PandemicLife #hightimes #cannabis\n#cannabiscommunity #weed # marijuana #cbd #thc #cannabisculture",
