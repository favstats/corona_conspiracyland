    "description": "This pandemic is bullshit. All this half-open nonsense needs to stop. Currently at The Black Box and I can't even sit by my friends. I have to respect the rules of the establishment because I don't want them to get shut down by the health department. But seriously this is getting out of hand. When is this going to end? \n\nEach day we get one step closer to a mandatory vaccination law. We're all being played like pawns in a chess game. I say we open the fuck up and go back to normal.\n\nWe're about to lose our venues and everything we love all because of a global agenda. FUCK THIS!!\n\nDon't you like my Jerry mask and hat tho?\n\n#covid #fuckbillgates\n#protest #nomadatoryvax\n#openupamerica",
