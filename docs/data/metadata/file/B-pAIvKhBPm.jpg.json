This type of self-righteous, fear-based behavior is disgusting and should be rejected immediately. Regardless of the nation you\u2019re in, cowering in the face of something like this should only embolden one\u2019s own self and your duty should be to uphold others.\nIn these trying times, governments feels the need to enforce such draconian measures because of the fragile yet polarized nature of society in which we find ourselves. Were we a stronger nation, we might be able to brave something so ambiguous, but I fear it\u2019s not just this incident which we are preparing for; the future is as unstable as it is gloomy. Even so, this should never dull our efforts.\nThe mission remains the same: maintaining our freedoms and liberties through a time of crisis while trying not to become disillusioned to the agendas at play. With nuanced ways of declaring martial law around the world, I think it\u2019s time to adjust our approach and rethink some of our tactics. This virus may infect countries with totalitarianism, but we can\u2019t falter. Even with people waking up, we don\u2019t need people dying in order to expose corruption.\n#FactionsOfFreedom #FreedomFaction #Podcast #AlternativeNews #ConsciousMedia #TruthSeeker #Killuminati #Agenda21 #Agenda2030 #NewWorldOrder #Technocracy #ScientificDictatorship #Coronavirus #CoViD19 #CoViD2020 #TrustThePlan #QAnon #FactCheck #ProjectAirbridge #ID2020 #CivilUnrest #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda",
