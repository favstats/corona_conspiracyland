    "description": "Reposted from @unparalleled_suffering  This is who you are eating when you decide to eat other beings. These are individuals who suffered perpetually since birth at the hands of the most invasive and self-destructive species. They now rot outside in a pile instead of on a store shelf and in someone's stomach. What an incredible species humans are, a species who chooses corpses over healthier options that never had to experience any conscious feelings of pain or terror or grief or panic or having their true desires and preferences and needs always unreachable to them. Even in the midst of a pandemic and even while experts are telling us there will be more, humans still fill their shopping carts and online orders with flesh from animals who lived lives marked by never ending disregard and filth. There is no hope for a species so resistant to change, for a species so resistant to basic fairness, and so resistant to abandoning traditions for a better way of living. Most of all, there is no hope for a species so passive and apathetic that they let those who are destroying the planet the most get away with their destruction day by day. RIP to the trillions of beings who have been robbed of their dignity and their existence for the sake of selfishness and greed.\u2063\n\u2063\n#humanssuck #pigsofig #animallovers #baconandeggs #baconeggandcheese #porkenderloins #porkbelly #honeybakedham #whatsforlunch #pandemic #knowyourfarmer #dairygood #pigfarm #babypigs #pettingzoo #carnivorediet #shaunking #antioppression #blacklivesmatter #rapeculture #depressionquotes #idiocracy #mindfulness #minimalistlifestyle#vegansofig #paleorecipes #baconwrappedhotdogs #pandemic #coronavirus #plandemic2020 #bekindtooneanother",
