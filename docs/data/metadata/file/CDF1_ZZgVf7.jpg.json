    "description": "Isn\u2019t this what Trump advocated for back in March when this all began? Isn\u2019t this the treatment governors like Cuomo banned from use in their states killing thousands who could have been saved by it? Isn\u2019t this the treatment the MSM said was \u201cdangerous\u201d and would potentially \u201ckill more people than it would save?\u201d \n\nThis is criminal. This is a crime against humanity to keep the most effective treatment we have against a virus from sick people. There are countries that have made hydroxychlorochine an over-the-counter drug. And it\u2019s very inexpensive. \n\nListen folks. This virus has already mutated enough that any vaccine they create will be totally ineffective. Covid is a flu and we all know the flu mutates every year, which is why the flu shot has never made the flu disappear.\n\nHundreds of doctors have used this drug with Covid and many 100% effectively. Use the brain God gave you to research and think logically. \n*\n*\n*\n#covid19 #coronavirus #quarantine #masks #vaccines #freedom #health #truth #lies #socialdistancing #newnormal #msm #plandemic #scamdemic #immunesystem #hydroxychloroquine #treatment #wakeup #billgates #killbill #faucifraud #firefauci #psyops #trump #maga #patriots #wwg1wga #unity #election #fraud",
