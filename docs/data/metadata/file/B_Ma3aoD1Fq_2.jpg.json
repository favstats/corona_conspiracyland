    "description": "So ask yourself why local health agencies who are not elected officials are making these decisions. \nCheck the chart for US deaths from COVID 19 (even though we know they have been padding the numbers) 18,747 ! How many died last year from the seasonal flu?? 80,000. How many died in 2019 from cancer ? 606,880 !  Why don\u2019t they close McDonald, why don\u2019t they ban known carcinogens like food dyes and TBHQ? \nBecause they don\u2019t care.  This is about control not concern for health. Stop letting your freedom and our countries solvency slip through our fingers! \n#Whatareyouwaitingfor #filmyourhospital #coronaisfake #endtheshutdown #getbacktowork #stopthefear #dontbesheep #takebackyourfreedom #arrestbillgates #firefauci #firebirx",
