As you may know Bill Gates has actively invested millions of dollars into blocking the sun which he says would help climate change. No matter what your feelings on the subject of the climate or change or climate change, I think we can all agree that blocking the sun is a really bad idea as a scientist have stated about this guy with no degrees who stole what he has for Microsoft and is making crazy willy-nilly statements all over the place. It\u2019s not even crazy. It\u2019s downright frightening. #HealthNutNews #ExposeBillGates #SayNoToBillGates #NaturalHealth #HolisticHealth #COVID-19 #ErinElizabeth",
