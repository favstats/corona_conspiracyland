Are theses earthquakes related to underground war?\n\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\nThere are documents available that expose a deep underground command center that was to be built far below areas such as Washington, D.C., and China Lake, California, during the Cold War. Documents show that in 1964 the military was considering building a huge underground cavity 4,000 feet deep beneath China Lake.\nIn America alone there are over 120 Deep Underground Military Bases situated under most major cities, US AFBs, US Navy Bases and US Army Bases, as well as underneath FE.\nThe Denver airports budget was twice the amount it should have been. These underground bases are wide enough to fit two semi trucks and go on for miles and even across the entire United States. These bases are underneath almost every airport. .\n.\n#haarp #wakeup #DeepState #wwg1wga #qanon #agenda2030 #agenda201 #adrenochrome #underworld #Dumbs #corona #savethechildren #NWO #elites #deepundergroundmilitarybases \n#cabal #MartialLaw #OneWorldOrder #FollowTheWhiteRabbit #Pizzagate #Depopulation #Underground #5G #HellOnEarth #GodHelpUsAll #repent \n#BATS5G",
