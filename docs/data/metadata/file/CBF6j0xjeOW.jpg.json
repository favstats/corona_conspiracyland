Either the WHO works without any ideological prejudices or we are out,\u201d he said.\n\nBolsanaro speaking to CNN Brasil on Friday night, cited the decision by\u00a0WHO to resume the testing of hydroxychloroquine\u00a0on COVID-19 patients after weeks of suspension. \u201cWe do not need any people from outside to give us tips about health here. \u201cWhat do we need this WHO for? The WHO recommended a few days ago not to carry on with the study into hydroxychloroquine, and now they are restarting it,\u201d he said.\n\nBrazil is one of the hardest-hit countries in the world by the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAtleast 646,000 cases have been recorded, and more than 35,000 deaths recorded from the virus so far.\n\nRecall that President Donald Trump sometime in May announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing its relationship with the WHO.\n\nHe accused WHO of mishandling the coronavirus pandemic which broke out from China.\n.\n.\n.\n#brazil #bolsonaro #brasil #covid19\n#truth #who #deepstate #organization\n#fearmongering #thegreatawakening",
