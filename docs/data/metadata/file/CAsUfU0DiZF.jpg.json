I told her that she said no to Bill Gates and her vaccines and no to 5 G, and declared this with the support of 200 artists. Then he investigated and returned 2 hours later. Then she said there is no such news. I searched with more detailed words and found a description text in French. She was very surprised because she scanned her tweets on Twitter until 2017 but could not reach this information. I said to her, there is a very severe censorship on the internet and worse will get worse. The same friend wanted to share Juliette Binoche's words on this topic today. Then she saw that instagram does not allow this. She said: \u201cIf I shared a nude photo of her, it wouldn't be a problem!\u201d As you can see friends, information is in the mouth of the lion. If we do not pursue real knowledge as a society, we will fall into that lion's mouth! Thank you Parisa. @pariiisa.ghasemi \u2764\ufe0f #coronalies #plandemic #corona #coronavirusiran #coronaturkiye",
