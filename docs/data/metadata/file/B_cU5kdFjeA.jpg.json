Make up your mind.\n\nExcerpts from the book Cannibalism, Blood Drinking and High Adept Satanism by Kerth Barker  #kerthbarker #wakethefuckup #thegreatawakening #rashidbuttar #covid_19 #newworldorder #adrenochrome #lettherebelight  #jesus #ascension #wakethefuckup #yogaistheanswer #spirituality #angels #davidicke #truthprevails #masteryourself  #loveoverfear #omnamahshivaya \"\"I think I should make it clear that the notion that modern people might engage in cannibalistic rituals is not far-fetched. Cannibalism has taken place throughout the history of the world and in many different regions. Human sacrifice rituals performed by a ruling elite can be found throughout history. And this isn\u2019t just in ancient times. There are some well-known blood drinkers from the not too distant past who can be found among European royalty. The Blood Countess, Elizabeth Bathory and Vlad the Impaler are known to history. When a high-degree Mason is initiated, he drinks blood from a human skull. And consider the peculiar rituals of the prominent Skull and Bones society of Yale University. The Satanist Anton LaVey held a public event back in the sixties where he invited spectators to eat human flesh; he claimed that he had acquired this flesh from a legal medical source. And of course, there are sensationalized accounts to be found in contemporary news stories of deranged serial killers, some of whom are blood drinkers or cannibals. Jeffrey Dahmer is just one of many who could be mentioned.\nNo one can deny that blood drinking does take place. All I am telling you is that it is more widespread than you have been led to believe. And you should understand that it is much better organized than you could probably imagine.\"\"",
