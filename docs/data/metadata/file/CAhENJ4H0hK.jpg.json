It is shameful how easy to control they are!\n.\n\nAfter originally recommending the country go on lockdown because of the \u201ceasy\u201d spread of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released a big \u201coops\u201d regarding how the agency now believes the coronavirus spreads.\n.\n\nAccording to the most recent revisions to CDC information, the virus is spread not so much on surfaces like store door knobs, products and restaurant tables, but from intimate contact between individuals.\n.\n\nThe news may come too late for businesses, big and small, on the verge of bankruptcy from lockdown orders that barred everything from sitting alone in a car in a church parking lot, walking in parks and swimming alone to buying flower seeds at Michigan\u2019s Home Depots and Lowes or buying a wedding ring.\n.\n\nThe new data may also raise questions about how both the CDC and local governments acted in the to rush close down the entire society before all information had been collected and verified.\n.\n\nhttps://bit.ly/2LOldvg\n.\n.\n\n#PLANdemic  #Covid1984 #CoronaVirus #Corona #PsyOp #Plandemic #Pandemic #Contagion #CoronaPsyOp #Covid19 #Covid_19 #Covid #FearPorn #Fearmongering #Covid19News #PoliceState #PoliceStateUSA #Amerika #America #ReopenAmerica #Reopen #WakeUpAmerica #WakeUp #StandUp #FireThemAll",
