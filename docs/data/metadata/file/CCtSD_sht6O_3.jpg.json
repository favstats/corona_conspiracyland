    "description": "This is your friendly reminder that this covid 19 came from a lab in Wuhan when the story broke. Look at world wide death rates. China reported a very low number. Look at the numbers. Look at flu, pneumonia, look at the money trail.\nIn CA, Gruesome Newsom spent $1B dollars in a deal with a Chinese Company, BYD, for n95 masks. That can\u2019t even pass inspection! Why not incentivize USA company to produce them? How come late 2019, CA congress passed a bill giving local health officials supreme power? Coincidence? People who know the truth know this has been the long term plan, Trump just wasn\u2019t suppose to be in office. \nOf course, mandatory vaccines are next.  They\u2019re already mandatory for kids to go to school here, they\u2019ll just add it to the list.\n.\n.\n.\n#wwg1wga #wedonotconsent #wethepeople #conservativememe #covidmemes #wakeup #thegreatawakening #freedomfights #communismsucks #freedomisntfree #wakeupslave #taketheredpill #stopbillgates #dividedwefall  #thestorm #openforbusiness #thestormishere",
