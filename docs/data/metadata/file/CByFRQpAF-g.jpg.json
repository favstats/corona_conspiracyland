    "description": "The Healthy American, Peggy Hall.\nI don't know how many other ways to say it: \"\"An executive order is not law.\"\" And an executive order cannot create law. No governor, mayor, or policeman can make law. There is a law-making procedure that has to be followed to create law. Law is the only thing that can compel you to do something. No individual public servant has the legal authority to create law. AND, we are no longer in a \"\"state of emergency\"\" -- that expired long ago. This is a recovery phase.\n.\nGo to - Healthy American Peggy Hall on YouTube and check out www.TheHealthyAmerican.org for amazing resources and to sign up for updates. .\n.\nYou can also follow her at: @peggythehealthyamerican\n.\n.\npeggyhall #thehealthyamerican\n#nomaskday #maskoff #nomask #wearamask (if you wanna die) #endmedicaltyranny #orangecounty #medicaltyranny #billgatesisevil #firefauci #coronavirus #scamdemic #icantbreathe #blacklivesmatter #alllivesmatter #drbuttar #filmyourhospital #maskfree #recallgavinnewsom\n #virusesareNOTcontagious\n#recallnewsom #savecalifornia\n#takebackcalifornia",
