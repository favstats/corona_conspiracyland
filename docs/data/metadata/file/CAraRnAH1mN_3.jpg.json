STOP EXPECTING THINGS TO CHANGE.\n\n#Ferguson 2.0 \nThey dont care if you do this. All these cops are getting paid overtime. So we just put more money back in their pockets. WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY EFFECT THEM IS IF EVERYONE OF US STOPPED SPENDING MONEY WITH THEM. IF WE SUED THE POLICE THEMSELVES AND NOT THE CITY. IF WE TOOK A LIFE FOR A LIFE. Get mad all you want but I am tried of our people moving emotionally. WE NEED TO UNIFY AND GET IN CODE. While the world only has to deal with the CORONAVIRUS. Black people still have to deal with #Racism and #PoliceBrutality. Smh The attack on our people never stops. \n#GeorgeFloyd\n#AhmaudArbery\n#SeanReed\n#BreonaTaylor \n#POPULATIONCONTROL \n#corona  #coronavirus  #Hr6666 #TraceAct #COVID19 #Shutdown #Martiallaw #quarantine  #pandemic #5G #Vaccination\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"\"\"\"fair use\"\"\"\" for purposes such as criticism. commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
