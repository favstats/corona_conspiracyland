This currently in Australia! \ud83d\udcfd by  @truthnotfear\n\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\nA surprise visit from the Melbourne police to a citizen\u2019s home because he attended a protest and somehow they knew that and found out where he lives.\nBefore they left they let him know he should expect a fine in the mail for attending the protest. Why did they come to his house to tell him that? And on top of that he has the right to protest! This is what the contact tracing BS would be like but even worse because it\u2019s normal citizens that would be doing it. \nThey are trying to enforce the NWO around the world and people are NOT having it. We will not comply to this bullshit and these cops should find some real criminals to arrest.\n.\n.\n.\n#MartialLaw #ID2020 #NewWorldOrder #MarkOfTheBeast #NWO #Q #QANON #DEEPSTATE #SocialDistancing #isolation #Cult #RFIDChip #Contacttracing #hr6666 #Fema #mandatoryvacation #BillGates #WHO #CDC #CoronaHoax #Quarantine #5G #Plandemic #Hoax #RFID",
