The total does not include ostensibly philanthropic spending via his Open Society Foundations network.\n-\n\nBeyond political spending recorded by the FEC, Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations network claims to have spent over $15 billion over the past three decades. The U.S. is the organization\u2019s primary target in terms of total dollars spent on any single country.\n-\n\nThe Open Society Foundation\u2019s 2020 budget was valued at over $1.2 billion, of which $261 million was spent targeting America. A majority of the $261 spent on the U.S. was said to fund \u201cdemocratic practice, economic equity and justice,\u201d \u201cequality and antidiscrimination,\u201d \u201cjustice reform and the rule of law,\u201d and \u201ccross-thematic\u201d programs. \n-\nIn other words, he is investing in ANTIFA, Black Lives Matters and to destroy the police.\n\u2022\n#hydroxychloroquine #coronavirus #covid19 #cdc #georgesoros #deepstate #cdcguidelines #quarantinelife #democrats #joebiden #usa #nyc #voterfraud #blacklivesmatter #backtheblue #votolatino #presidenttrump #california #maga2020 #fauci #cabal #latinos #wwg1wga #antifa #breakingnews #votolatino #walkaway #election2020 #protest\n\nRepost from @puertorican_for_trump",
