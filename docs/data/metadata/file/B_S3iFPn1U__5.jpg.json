    "description": "A number of mathematical models of the COVID-19 epidemic also support the conjecture that transmission of the virus from children is rare or absent. In places where schools remained open, such as Hong Kong and Iceland, there is no evidence they were important places of transmission. One detailed investigation of an infected nine-year-old boy in France did not detect a single secondary case after he had contact with 112 peers and adults at three different schools during his symptomatic period. The currently available literature, though still quite limited, therefore supports the theory that children pass on the infection rarely if at all.\n\nhttps://nationalpost.com/opinion/opinion-on-covid-19-we-are-epidemiologists-and-its-probably-safe-to-reopen-some-schools\n\n#wedonotconsent #covid19 #covid #coronavirus #endthelockdown #freedom #nomandates #nomandatescanada #informedconsent #notobillgates #saynotobillgates #stopid2020 #reopencanada #nonewnormal #truth \n#reopencanqda #vaccinechoicecanada",
