    "description": "Look at this beautiful sunset and everyone social distancing. Captured this golden hour moment just last week at our favorite spot. It\u2019s healing and rejuvenating. How is this more dangerous than going to crowded Walmarts and Costcos where everyone\u2019s touching the produce and fruit? .\n.\n@gavinnewsom announced all CA beaches and state parks be prohibited as of May 1, all because beaches in Orange County were overcrowded during last week\u2019s heatwave. The Dept of Homeland Security just released a study showing direct sunlight and high humidity kills CV quickly. The virus thrives in temperature controlled environments, like stores, e.g. Walmarts and Costcos. .\n.\nThe Huntington Beach City Council voted 5 to 2 in favor of suing Newsom for his unconstitutional and authoritative orders. We\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens next. I already miss going to the beach. .\n.\n.\nProtests are being held across the state today (May 1) demanding CA be reopened. We\u2019ve done our part. People need to get back to work. Businesses are hurting and closing, food pantry lines are getting longer, most haven\u2019t received their stimulus checks and unemployment claims yet. It\u2019s crazy that some still want everything to be shut down. If you want to quarantine yourself, no one\u2019s stopping you. But, small businesses must re-open now and entrepreneurs and self employed need to start working again! . .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. .\n#reopencalifornia #newnormal #stayathome #socialdistancing #constitutionalrights #unconstitutional #pandemic #scamdemic #coronavirus #covid19 #medicalfreedom #informedconsent #holistichealing #negativeions #openourbeaches #wakeupamerica #wakeup #wwg1wga #backtowork #reopenamerica #1a #2a #darktolight #freedom #freedomfighters #unitednotdivided",
