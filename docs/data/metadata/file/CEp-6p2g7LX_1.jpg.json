    "description": "@djokernole is the 3rd Greatest #tennis player of all times en route to become the greatest, yet because he likes to speak his mind is not as liked and popular as other sport personalities. \nDuring the European summer he was crucified by media because with other players, he tested positive to covid.\n4 months ago the @guardianaustralia talked about his career at risk because of his position against a #covid #vaccine . \nNovak is notorious also for his professionalism and strict healthy diet.\nLast week he won his #master1000 number 35 (shared record) and today he won the 2nd match at the @usopen !\nLet results do the talk Novak ! \nKudos to @serenawilliams for saying today that \"\"he has strong opinions that are often true\"\".\nWhile he is winning tournements, players like Nick Kyrgios (real role model...) Has decided to skip the US open for fear of the virus... also criticising Djokovic because \"\"he plays tennis while people are dying\"\"... \nI Must say #brainwashing in Australia has worked really well...\n\n#pandemic #plandemic2020 #covidscam #covid #covid19 #virus #freedom #nofacemask  #wakeupaustralia #Melbourne #Victoria #Australia #fakenews\n#sackdanielandrews #dictatorship #idonotconsent #nojabnopay",
