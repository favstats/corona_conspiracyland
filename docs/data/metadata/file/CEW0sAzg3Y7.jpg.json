    "description": "Is COVID still really a thing or are people just ready to get on with life? Like aside from the mask wearing to go into certain businesses I\u2019ve just been over here livin. \n\nCan we all agree that it\u2019s time to carry on?! Like one minute the CDC is recommending everyone go get tested and now they\u2019re saying don\u2019t go get tested. One minute Toni Fauci is saying we look like we\u2019re going to have a record speed promising vaccine and the next minute he is saying the fast forwarding of the vaccine could be dangerous and he isn\u2019t sure if it will be effective. \n\nI see what\u2019s going on here. It\u2019s called politics! It\u2019s time to get back to life and stop being swayed by the BS. The media is determined to keep us all fighting and keeping us believing the lies of whatever political party they are funded by. \n\nThe Solution?? Make your own informed decisions and don\u2019t watch the news! And for me personally, I\u2019ve been limiting my social media time. It seems whenever I open Facebook, outside of making a post, all that I see is NEGATIVITY, VIOLENCE, and HATRED. It can make you feel like the world is coming to an end. \n\nI am choosing to MOVE ON! \n#overcovid19 #plandemic2020",
