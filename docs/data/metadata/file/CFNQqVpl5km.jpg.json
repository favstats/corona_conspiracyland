They will use their little power as intimidation behind their \u00f8 facts and knowledge ! This is what happens when you elect democrats, No plan, no action, No rights, no freedom! STAND UP HAWAII! Walk with faith! Be strong! Stay True! \n\n@hfic808 @for_our_rights_kauai @missioninactionpodcast @b_i_beast808 @cowboy.is.back akamaihi @plyexit @hawaiinewsreports @ltgovjoshgreen @mayorkirkhnl @govhawaii @realdonaldtrump \n\n#GodsArmy #InfoWar #Programming #NoNewNormal #AlohaGate #constitution #Bluestate #PoliceState #NWO #Q #Freedomfighter #covid_19 #Covid #HawaiiLockdown #stayhomeorder #DONTTREADONME #Plandemic #Scamdemic #trump",
