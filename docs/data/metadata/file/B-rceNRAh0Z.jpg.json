A very small summer festival with a great atmosphere and always a stunning line-up. \ud83d\ude0d Hatebreed was one of the headliners in 2018. I remember this very hot summer evening with a very sweaty moshpit. \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd18 Hatebreed live is always a pleasure. \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude4f\n.\n.\n.\n#memories #fuckcorona #socialdistancing #stayathome #festivallover #summerfeeling #festivalseason #hatebreed #metalgirl #hardcoremusic #heavymetal #metalcore #moshpit #headbanger #summerdreams #enjoyinglife #sunshine #nordopenair #qualitytime #havingfun #fucknwo #staysafe #healthylifestyle #musiclover #concertlover #happygirl #lebenundlebenlassen #seelenbalsam #krafttanken #gl\u00fccksmomente",
