    "description": "I strongly agree that there is something wrong with Denver Airport. .\n.\nThe apocolyptic murials, the gargoyle statues, Blucifer the horse statue with fiery red eyes that shine bright at night, the Masonic time capsule, the swastika runways, the list is endless.\n.\n.\nHowever this is not from Denver murals, which are bad enough even without this illustration, but from the Phillipini artist CJ Trinidad, made in 2020. Nevertheless, the picture shows all the misery of the \"\"Covid-19\"\" scam...its important that us lightworkers do our best to not post wrong information as it will put the sleepers back into their coma!\n.\n.\nI appreciate its difficult with so much fake info around, I myself have even fallen in to the trap once or twice. .\nI will post something about #denverairport for you after this post. .\n.\n\n#Denverairport #wakeupsheeple #wwg1wga #fuckthegoverment #followthemoney #populationcontrol #doyourownresearch #plandemic #scamdemic #hoax #agenda2030 #agenda21 #corona #thegreatawakening #nwo #NEWWORLDORDER #martiallaw #photooftheday #woke #Fuckbillgates #rothschildfamily #billandmelindagatesfoundation #downtherabbithole #deepstate #hiddenagenda #WAKETHEFUCKUP",
