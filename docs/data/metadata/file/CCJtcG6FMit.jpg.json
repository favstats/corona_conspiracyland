Indifference to this notion is the means by which we will secure our own oppression.\u201d\n\n-Thomas Jefferson\n\n\u2022\n\n\u201cThose who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.\u201d\n\n-Benjamin Franklin \n\n\u2022\n\nAt the Constitutional Convention, Benjamin Franklin was approached by a group of citizens asking what sort of government the delegates had created. \nHis answer was: \"\"A republic, if you can keep it.\"\" \n\u2022\n\nBy blindly acquiescing to the demands of known liars & murderers, aka the CULT, are we keeping it? Or are we getting closer to Communist China?\n\n\u2022\n\nThe brevity of Franklin\u2019s response should not cause us to under-value its essential meaning: Constitutional Republics are not merely founded upon the consent of the people, they are also absolutely dependent upon the active & informed involvement of We the People for their continued good health.\n\n\u2022\n\n\u201cHe who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.\u201d \n\n-Martin Luther King, Jr. \n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#mandatoryvaccinations #fight5G #orderoutofchaos #chaosbydesign #coronavirus #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #martiallaw #covid19 #plandemic #problemreactionsolution",
