    "description": "The absurdity of those who insist on others to follow in their own footsteps of stupidity. We live in a free nation. And you are free to be as stupid as you want. But do not expect to impose your stupidity on me.\n.\nCompliance with stupidity = consent to tyranny + consent to being assaulted\n.\nOf course, the stupidity is being perpetuated and propagated by mainstream media. The executive order the President Trump signed a few days ago will hopefully put an end to the censorship nonsense. Keep up your efforts. Do not give in. Fight the rhetoric and misinformation with truth and information. Do not allow science to die!\n.\n#covid19 #covidconspiracy #corona #patriots #patriot #qanon #DrButtar #AHEADMAP #AdvancedMedicine #AdvancedMedicineConference #IADFW #Fitness #Longevity #livelonger #livehealthy #power #facts #knowledge #truth #empowerment #livefree #livefreeordie #populationcontrol #whistleblower #soldiers #wechangetheworld #healthfreedom #health #freedom #medicalfreedom",
