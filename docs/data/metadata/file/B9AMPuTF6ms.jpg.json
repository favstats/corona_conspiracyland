    "description": "Panic is beginning to grip Asia as\u00a0new video and images\u00a0have emerged showing hundreds of people standing in lines that look to stretch for blocks in order to obtain a mask in efforts to protect themselves from contracting the deadly #virus. This report comes as the inventory of surgical face masks is plunging across Asia, and anxious citizens form long queues at supermarkets and pharmacies hoping to get their hands on some before they run out. Reports from citizens in #Singapore, Shanghai, and Hong Kong claim the masks have sold out at most local shops.
