    "description": "While the eyes of the world are on the novel coronavirus, East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Southwest Asia and Pakistan continues to struggle with another crisis of biblical proportions: growing swarms of ravenous locusts. Both crises are extraordinary in scale, and both foes multiply so quickly that governments are struggling to contain them. Torrential rain is causing a dramatic increase in locust numbers in East Africa, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and Yemen.\nOn January the 11th, 2019, the holiest site in Islam was swarmed by a plague of locusts, forcing cleaners into action to drive the insects out.\u00a0The Great Mosque in Mecca, which hosts millions of Muslim pilgrims every year and is the holiest site in Islam was the birthplace of a plague which in just over 12 months would grow into billions, stretching from the western border of China sweeping through Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, through Arabia the Middle East, northern Africa and all the way down to Southern Africa.\u00a0TBW.\u00a0The numbers and size of the plagues are unfathomable, we are talking billions of the most ravenous beast known to man, just a small swarm can eat enough food to feed a city of 35,000 people. These swarms are currently invading the poorest and most food-insecure people on the planet and the swarms are expected to increase 5 fold by June.\nSwarms have matured in East Africa after widespread rains that fell in late March are expected to cause a dramatic increase in locust numbers in the coming months.\n#JesusIsComingSoon #Repent #EndOfTheWorld #EndTimes #AreYouReady #Tukkit #SignsOfTheTimes #SpiritualWarfare #Eygypt #Pharaoh #ClimateChange #Africa #JesusSaves #Mecca #Exodus #CurrentSituation #Yolo #Covid_19 #China #Locusts #Prophecy #Prepper #Passover #LastDays #MarkOfTheBeast #MiddleEast #NewWorldOrder #SaudiArabia",
