    "description": "THESE IMAGES ARE REPOSTED but I can't remember from where...\n---\nAnywhom,\n\nThe LORD is coming and HE is MUCH closer than everyone realizes and though we may not know the day or the hour, the LORD, though telling the saints who will be in the tribulation, says: \"\"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed\u00a0is\u00a0he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.\"\" (Rev. 16:15)\n\nWe can use this verse and apply it to right now. Though you keep watch, are you keeping your garments? \n\n\"\"The allusion to keeping one's garments on, that he may not go about naked and exposed, draws upon the custom of the day when men wore loose fitting robes. When a man walked quickly or ran or climbed stairs, the robe could become untied and fall open. Men wearing robes needed to be alert and careful about their behavior so their robes would not slip open. An unclothed person inside their house, also, is not prepared for a sudden visitor or to rush out in an emergency. Staying clothed, in a spiritual sense, means believers need to be careful about their behavior (Ephesians 5:8; 1 John 2:28).\"\"\n--\nSo, exactly, how ready are you? If the LORD were to come today, do you think HE'D be pleased with how you've been acting? How you've been presenting yourself? As followers of Christ, we represent HIM here on earth. Our actions are supposed to reflect the character of CHRIST. \n\nSo, how've you been doing with that?\n--\n#godsaves #id2020 #GOD #falseprophets #oneworldgovernment #newworldorder #satanicagenda #femacamps #fema #pedogate #pizzagate #chemtrails #secondcoming #microchip #vaccines #nocoronavirus #Jesus #Christ #wickednessinhighplaces #seekredemption #repent #jesuschristsaves #reflect #trustGod #prayerwarrior #prayerispowerful #freemasonry",
