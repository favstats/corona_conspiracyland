    "description": ".\n.\nErin Marie Olszewski is a Nurse turned investigative journalist, who has spent the last few months on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic, on the inside in two radically different settings. Two hospitals.\u00a0One private, the other public.\u00a0One\u00a0in Florida, the other in New York.\n\nAnd not just any New York public hospital, but the \"\"\"\"epicenter of the epicenter\"\"\"\" itself, the infamous Elmhurst in Donald Trump's Queens. As a result of these diametrically opposed experiences, she has the ultimate \"\"\"\"perspective on the pandemic\"\"\"\".\u00a0She has been where there have been the\u00a0most\u00a0deaths attributed to Covid-19 and where there have been the\u00a0least.\n\nErin enlisted in the Army when she was 17. She deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. Part of her duties involved overseeing aid disbursement and improvements to hospital facilities. While in country she received the Army Commendation Medal for meritorious service, and was wounded in combat. Erin eventually retired as a sergeant, and became a civilian nurse in 2012.\nErin is a medical freedom and informed consent advocate. She co-founded the Florida Freedom Alliance but no longer has any connection with the organization.\n\n#tuckerCarlson #whistleblower #erinmarieolszewski\n#covid19 #emptyhospitals #notmyvirus #flattenthecurve #wearamask #plandemicthemovie #drjudymikovits #davidicke #scamdemic #hoax #controlavirus #nursinghomes #coronavirus\n#theundercoverepicenternurse",
