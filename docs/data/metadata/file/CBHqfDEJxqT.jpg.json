    "description": "Hundreds of Italian demonstrators, known as the Orange Vests, gathered in Rome and ditched their masks in a protest against the government\u2019s lockdown restrictions. \u2022\n\nSpeakers at the protest asserted that the lockdown was an infringement of freedom and some said that the pandemic \u2018\u2019never existed\u2019\u2019 and that politicians had played it up to enhance their own powers. \u2022\nLeague Party chief Matteo Salvini, the former Minister of the Interior, led a march in another area of Rome and demanded that the government resign. \u2022\n\nRefusing to wear a mask himself, Pappalardo said \"\"These lungs mine. I will take care of my lungs. Breathing is sacred.\"\" \u2022\nAccording to a Facebook post by Salvini, the march was \"\"a symbolic gesture to make heard the voices of the citizens who do not give up.\"\" \u2022 \u270a\ud83c\udffd https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/enraged-italians-abandon-masks-denounce-pandemic-scam \ud83e\udda0 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\n#mandatoryvaccinations #fight5G #eugenics #orderoutofchaos #chaosbydesign #contacttracing #coronavirus #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #martiallaw #covid1984 #problemreactionsolution #scamdemic #conspiracyreality #covidiots #5G #chemtrails\n#geoengineering #climatechangehoax #wtc7 #soros #billgates #rothschild #zionists #rockefeller #depopulation #technocracy #kill5G  #electromagneticwaronhumanity",
