But I do know the grocery stores in my towns are closing hours earlier and they claim it\u2019s for new \u201cdisinfecting\u201d policies and procedures that take hours for them to complete each night. Don\u2019t be surprised when we have an upswing of transverse myelitis (aka polio), GBS and similar chemical induced neurological disorders.\n\nPick up homesteading, organic gardening, holistic healing, herbalism, \u201clet food be thy medicine\u201d and learn to cultivate the land. It\u2019s really the only way to protect your families now.\n---\n#Repost @controversial_mama .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#blogger #bigpharma #bloodbrainbarrier #behealthy #covid19 #chronicillness #chronicdisease #healthnut #consumerawareness #detox #educateyourself #healthy #growyourownfood #gmo #genocide #holisitic #idoNOTconsent #informedconsent #knowledgeispower #momblog #naturalliving #organic #plandemic #parenting #toxinfree",
