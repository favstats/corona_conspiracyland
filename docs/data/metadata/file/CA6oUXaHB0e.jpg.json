    "description": "Germany\u2019s federal government and mainstream media are engaged in damage control after a report that challenges the established Corona narrative leaked from the interior ministry.\n.\nSome of the report key passages are:\nThe dangerousness of Covid-19 was overestimated: probably at no point did the danger posed by the new virus go beyond the normal level.\n.\nThe people who die from Corona are essentially those who would statistically die this year, because they have reached the end of their lives and their weakened bodies can no longer cope with any random everyday stress (including the approximately 150 viruses currently in circulation).\n.\nWorldwide, within a quarter of a year, there has been no more than 250,000 deaths from Covid-19, compared to 1.5 million deaths [25,100 in Germany] during the influenza wave 2017/18.\n.\nThe danger is obviously no greater than that of many other viruses. There is no evidence that this was more than a false alarm.\n.\nA reproach could go along these lines:\n.\nDuring the Corona crisis the State has proved itself as one of the biggest producers of Fake News.\n.\nSo far, so bad. But it gets worse.\n.\nhttps://bit.ly/3ck3k21\n.\n.\n\n#PLANdemic  #Covid1984 #CoronaVirus #Corona #PsyOp #Plandemic #Pandemic #Contagion #CoronaPsyOp #Covid19 #Covid_19 #Covid #FearPorn #Fearmongering #Covid19News #PoliceState #PoliceStateUSA #Amerika #America #ReopenAmerica #Reopen #WakeUpAmerica #WakeUp #StandUp #FireThemAll",
