    "description": "A SWARM of locusts turned the sky black when millions of the insects descended onto motorists in the Middle East.\nThe terrifying video was filmed from inside a car in Bahrain yesterday when drivers were set upon by millions of locusts. The swarm has made its way from East Africa to China, via the Middle East, Pakistan and India.\nThe sky above Bahrain, usually a bathed in sunshine, can be seen turning dark as the swarm cloud moves over the road.\nAt one point, one of the insects drops onto the photographer\u2019s car and appears to be several inches long. *Full Length Compilation on my YouTube*\n#JesusIsComingSoon #Repent #EndOfTheWorld #EndTimes #AreYouReady #Tukkit #SignsOfTheTimes #SpiritualWarfare #ClimateChange #Africa #JesusSaves #CurrentSituation #Yolo #Coronavirus #China #Locusts #Prophecy #Prepper #Bahrain #LastDays #MarkOfTheBeast #MiddleEast #NewWorldOrder #SaudiArabia",
