Why would Coumo go out of his way to not thank God? \n#Repost @tukker_barnes\n\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\nOn the Monday after Easter,\u00a0during a press conference, Cuomo signaled cautious optimism about the ongoing situation in New York. With the numbers beginning to level off\u2014\u201c18,000, 18,000, 18,000\u2026the numbers suggest a plateauing, slight increase, but a plateauing, which is what the experts have talked about. That\u2019s what the numbers say. I also say whatever those numbers say is a direct result of what we do. I\u2019ve said if we do something stupid, you will see those numbers go right back up tomorrow, period. The worst can be over, and it is over unless we do something reckless.\u201d That is easy to agree with. What Governor Cuomo said next, however, is not. \u201cThe number is down because\u00a0we\u00a0brought the number down,\u201d he told the press. \u201cGod did not do that. Faith did not do that. Destiny did not do that. A lot of pain and suffering did that\u2026That\u2019s how it works. It\u2019s math. And if you don\u2019t continue to do that, you\u2019re going to see that number go back up. And that will be a tragedy if that number goes back up.\u201d That\u2019s a pretty bold statement coming from a governor presiding over a pandemic that is currently leveling thousands and filling a mass grave as things begin to slightly improve: \u201cGod did not do that.\u201d #JesusIsComing #SignsOfTheTimes #PredictiveProgramming #Heath #Tukkit  #OneWorldReligion #MartialLaw #NewYork #Praise #Virus #NYC #FalseFlag #Truth #WakeUp #OpenYourEyes #Manhattan #Quarantine #COVid_19 #NewWorldOrder #MarkOfTheBeast #Awakening #HomeWorkout #WakeUp #EndTimes #ComingSoon #Prepare #Church",
