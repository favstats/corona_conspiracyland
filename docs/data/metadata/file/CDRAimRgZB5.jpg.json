    "description": "Redpill Blondie makes some valid points. \n\nBut I too have questions, \n\n1: How is possible to erase that video from social platforms at such speed but keep Bill Gates vaccine videos up...he's no Doctor. \nWhat about the pedo accounts still  live ..wheres the speed for them? \n\n2: If hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin & zinc doesn't work why are they so worried about people having access to it? I get that people are saying it is dangerous but before the Plandemic you could get a prescription for HCQ just by saying you were going to a country where malaria could be present. That's how \"\"dangerous\"\" it is.\n\n3: 6000 Doctors across the world have said #Hydroxychloroquine\nworks in covid patients. multiple studies in France found it effective but its suppressed in USA, why? \n\n4: I noticed that Hydroxychloroquine is also a drug to help fight malaria and has many studies as an anti Cancer agent. \n\nIt costs around 80\u00a2 or less per pill where as Remdesivir is $400 per dose\n\nBut It's not just money.\n\nIf people realise that Hydroxychloroquine works:\n\n1) Trump will win by a landslide\n2) The mainstream media and social media companies will be exposed\n3) The public will demand blood from the above's executives\n4) Many government agencies will implode.\n\nFauci stands to make billions along with Gates in the peddling of their corona vaccine, that\u2019s why he's forcing the removal of all videos.\n\nSomething doesn't sit right here. \n\nThe same people who sell the panic sell the vaccine.\n\n#Hydroxychloroquine\n#wakeupsheeple #wwg1wga #fuckthegoverment #followthemoney #populationcontrol #doyourownresearch #plandemic #scamdemic #hoax #agenda2030 #corona #virus #thegreatawakening #nwo #NEWWORLDORDER #martiallaw #photooftheday #woke #Fuckbillgates #covid19 #billandmelindagatesfoundation #downtherabbithole #picoftheday #hiddenagenda #WAKETHEFUCKUP",
