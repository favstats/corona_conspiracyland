I do not want to recieve any comments saying \n.\n.\nFactcheckers have already debunked it. \n .\n.\nSnopes told us it was fake\n.\n.\n(Snopes, I hate it when you use Snopes to debunk anything, you do realize that Snopes \nIs just a mom-and-pop operation that began as a hobby. David and Barbara Mikkelson in the San Fernando Valley of California) If you want to verify this then go and do the research yourself.\n.\n.\n\nFactcheckers is a fraud and The AI machine learning is broken it's the keywords that we use that decide whether it's fake or not to them! \n\nThe main idea behind factcheckers is to stop fear!!
