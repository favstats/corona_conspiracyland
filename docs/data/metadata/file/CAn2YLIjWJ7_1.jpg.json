    "description": "DEATHS DUE TO LOCKDOWN \u2022\n.\nSlide 1. Doctors in Northern California say they have seen more deaths from suicide than they\u2019ve seen from the coronavirus during the pandemic.\n.\nSlide 2. India had recorded 4,021 deaths on account of COVID-19 by May 25; deaths on account of the lockdown, not directly related to the novel coronavirus, stood at 611 a few days ago. The actual figure could be higher, since the process of recording involved dependence on media reports of such death.\n.\nSlide 3. Suicides have claimed more lives in the Bokaro district than Covid-19 during the nationwide lockdown.\nWhile more than nine youths aged between 18 and 20 have killed themselves in the district in the past 19 days, only one person has died due to the virus in the district, which has since April reported 15 cases. Almost all who committed suicide hanged themselves.\n.\n.\n.\n#lockdown #covid19 #suicide #fearmongering #unemployment #hungergames #deepstate\n#secretsocieties #eugenics #dictatorship\n#conspiracyrealist #usa #northcalifornia\n#india #world #freedom #tyranny #truth #thegreatawakening",
