Get off of me,\u201d shouts the woman as she is grappled up against the wall.\n\nAfter she kicks out a few times, the male officer then drags her to the ground by her throat.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucked in the head, you\u2019re fucked, what the hell are you doing to me?\u201d asks the woman as the officer wrestles with her on the floor.\n\nLast week we highlighted a similar case where a woman was left with severe bruising after being manhandled by officers for violating the lockdown.\n\nUnder the new rules, people are expected to adhere to a strict 8pm-5am curfew and police have the power to enter people\u2019s homes without a warrant to enforce compliance spot checks.\n\nAs we previously reported, within moments of the new lockdown rules being announced, eyewitnesses said police surrounded residential tower blocks in Melbourne to prevent people from leaving.\n\nHowever, instead of just handing out fines as would normally be expected, police officers in the region appear to be enforcing the law by physically restraining and arresting people. \n\n#CoViD1984 #PoliceState #Scamdemic #Plandemic #Melbournelockdown #Communist #Freedom #GetAngry #Melbourne #Australia \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa #WakeupAustralia #VictoriaPolice #ExitTheMatrix",
