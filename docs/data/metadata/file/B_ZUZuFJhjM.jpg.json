Airports won\u2019t have large crowds. Sports will be played in basically empty stadiums. And the world economy will be depressed because demand will stay low.\u201d He said life will only return to normal when most of the population is vaccinated, and that could take years, though he hopes that one will be in mass production by the second half of 2021. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it will be a history-making achievement: the fastest humankind has ever gone from recognizing a new disease to immunizing against it,\u201d Gates wrote. .\nRepost @freedom_faction",
