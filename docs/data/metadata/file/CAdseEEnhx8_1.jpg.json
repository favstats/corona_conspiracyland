WHEN ITS A WHITE MAN WELL YOU SEE WHAT THEYBARE DOING TO THIS MAN. He guilt first and never innocent because we do not have the right in their eyes to defend ourselves. \n#JavanBerry, Has had a on going problem with his racist white neighbor. On the day on th incident. Mr Berry callef police telling them there was a trespasser who ran off but then stated he had shot the trespasser and the person was deceased.\"\"\"\" Mr berry was driving in the area of Sunrise Drive and Miller Road before they were contacted by the victim, identified as 51-year-old Richard Mladick, who was blocking the roadway with his truck. (sound familiar it should its the same thing  the two criminals did when they murdered AhmaudArbery) Berry said Mladick yelled out racial slurs, threatened them and walked back to his truck. Berry believed Mladick was going to get a gun from his vehicle. Berry said he retrieved his own gun and fired shots at Mladick\u2019s legs but didn\u2019t intend to kill him. Authorities say Berry and Mladick had an ongoing conflict over property ownership. Berry remains jailed in Phoenix on suspicion of second-degree murder.\n#irunwithahmaud #IRunWithMaud\n#AhmaudArbery #Joggingwhileblack\n#SeanReed\n#BreonaTaylor \nWhile the world only has to deal with the CORONAVIRUS.
