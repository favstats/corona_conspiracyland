    "description": "As we all know the coronavirus is a worldwide pandemic that has caused the world to go into lockdown. The media has put the masses in a state of fear. There are many people that believe this is a real virus and there are those who believe it is the _G frequencies. Although we are on lockdown, there are many businesses and buildings that are having 5G towers built next to them. There are rumors of schools having _G installed covertly. There are also towers being built next to residential homes and local businesses. In this video a concerned citizen witnesses a local church getting _G antennas installed into the base of the cross.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nDo you think it is coincidence this is happening now? How many videos have you seen of animals, insects, and plants being affected by these radio wave frequencies? This is not by accident it is an orchestrated plan.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nThese elite families who run the world and corporations do not care for the masses. We are treated as mere cattle. A heard of sheep who do their bidding, keep their machine going, pay them for our hard work and suffer if we do not live by their standards. This is 2020 and we still have poverty and homelessness.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nThere are many things taking place behind the scenes that we have no idea about. It usually takes for someone on the inside to reveal to the people that we have been deceived. Sometimes controlled opposition and sometimes a person who spoke too much truth then ends up committing suicide somehow.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nIt\u2019s time to wake up. These towers are not here for the advancement of our nation. They\u2019re to advance the control and power over the masses, the 7.5billion people on earth. The goal is for a one world government, it\u2019s been said on multiple occasions by our elected officials. ie (George Bush Sr)\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nIf we are going to be saved it has to start with us. We cannot depend on our oppressors to be our saviors. A slave may not always think they are enslaved. They might just think, \u201cthis is life\u201d. Think about it.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nWe are the 7billion.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n#SIGNin tell us what you think.\nComment. Like.
