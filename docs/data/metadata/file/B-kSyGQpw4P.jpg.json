I have even noticed a lot of towers being built next to or near by cannabis dispensaries as well \ud83e\udd14 \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022Repost from @standup911\n\u2022\nDid anyone catch the Verizon commercial of them promoting 5G technology with helping firefighters during a fire? What they failed to mention are the hundreds if not thousands of firefighters who reported health issues when the 5G towers were installed on the sides of their buildings and how many of the firefighters have protested to have them removed.\n\nI find it most interesting that Israel did the majority of R&D of this technology and they also banned the use of 5G in their illegal occupation.\n.\n#evilclouds #payattention #5g #stop5g #5gdeathtowers #5gcoronavirus #corona #coronavirus #coronavirusismanmade #end5g #wedonotconsent #wedonotconsentto5g #verizon5g #tmobile5g #wearewakingup #emf #smartmetersmakeyousick #descending5g #5gwilldescend #revolution #revolutioncomingsoon",
