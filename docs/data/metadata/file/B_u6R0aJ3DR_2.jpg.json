    "description": "That\u2019s a ~27,000 difference. The CDC added the total death rate, excluding pneumonia and flu deaths. It\u2019s a significant difference. Even though the total number of deaths included suspected deaths, it still looks like it\u2019s on par with flu deaths, which account for about 80,000 deaths each year. Suspected deaths include those who tested negative but had CV symptoms like asthma, respiratory and heart issues, and those who weren\u2019t tested. .\n.\nSurprisingly, this is on the CDC\u2019s website, yet the news is still going with 64,382. .\n.\nOn April 11, the total death rate (minus pneumonia & flu) was 11K, and the total amount (with pneumonia & flu) was 54K, which the news was reporting. .\n.\nWhich amount do you think should be reported? .\n.\n.\n.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm\n.\n.\n#coviddeaths #didyouknow #facts #truth #medicalfreedom #informedconsent #themoreyouknow #holistichealing #holistichealth #thegreatawakening #darktolight #wwg1wga #thestorm #quarantinelife #truthseeker #covid19 #ccpvirus #coronavirus #saveamerica #wakeupamerica #unitednotdivided",
