    "description": "Rhode Island State Police troopers and National Guard members began actively stopping passenger vehicles with New York license plates on Friday after Gov. Gina Raimondo ordered anyone traveling from the Empire State to the Ocean State to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.\nTroopers set up a checkpoint on I-95 in Hope Valley where drivers with New York license plates must stop and provide their contact information if they plan on staying in Rhode Island long-term.\nThose who do plan to stay in Rhode Island for an extended period of time are ordered to self-quarantine for 14 days before going out in public. Anyone passing through will be allowed to continue on their travels without providing information.\nThe number of COVID-19 cases confirmed in the New York metro area has grown to more than 30,000 in recent days, which prompted Raimondo to mandate the self-quarantine order. \u201cWe know New York is a hot spot, we know it\u2019s a dangerous place,\u201d she said.\n#JesusIsComing #SignsOfTheTimes #PredictiveProgramming #Heath #Tukkit #PoliceState #JadeHelm15 #MartialLaw #NewYork #ConspiracyTheory #Virus #JadeHelm #FalseFlag #RhodeIsland #WakeUp #OpenYourEyes #Obama #Quarantine #COVid_19 #NewWorldOrder #MarkOfTheBeast #Awakening #Pandemic #FEMAcamps #EndTimes #ComingSoon #Prepare #Technology",
