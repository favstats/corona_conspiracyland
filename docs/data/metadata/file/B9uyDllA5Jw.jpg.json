    "description": "5G technology runs in a much higher frequency spectrum than existing wireless communications signals. The 24-100 GHz frequencies will not go through walls well and is very directional meaning it's implementation will require many more times the number of transmitters we already have for 4G and 3G technology. More transmitters mean they will need to be installed even closer to where you live.\n\nThe problem is that this essentially turns these transmitters into HPM (high powered microwave) beam weapon systems which have already been developed by the military and this is well documented in the military periodicals for anyone that wishes to dig deeper on this subject. \nWatch episode 16 anytime here:\u00a0https://youtu.be/d9McUdPcuIw\n\n#coronavirus #virus #martiallaw #5g #5gtowers #5gsyndrome #frequencies #governmentconspiracy #conspiracytheory #shutdown #wuhan #hollyweirdisevil #sheeple #stop5g #agenda21 #depopulation #newworldorder #chemtrails #geoengeenering #weather #climatechange #climatecrisis #climatedisruption #haarp #fluoride\u00a0#cellphones #diseases #bigpharma #medication #smartmeter",
