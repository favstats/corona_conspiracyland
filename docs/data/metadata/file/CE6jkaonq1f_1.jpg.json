    "description": "So I was going through my phone deleting photos and came across pics of me last year when Covid did not exist and all the outings and events I got to go to \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2d legit every time I knew I had an event it always motivated me to stick to diet and exercise \ud83d\ude05 so this year I\u2019ve been all over the place with consistency. Hopefully this all ends soon so I can have an excuse to dress up again and have a fancy night out in Melbourne \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udd25 we were supposed to have our HUF end of challenge event in March and I full on bought an outfit. Now it\u2019s just sitting in my wardrobe collecting dust. Lord help us lol #precovid#2019memories#outfits#bestyear#livinglife#missgoingout#homeworkout#gymgarage#plandemic2020#whenwillthisend#gains#love#",
