If they are armed last time I checked moments like these are why we need the second amendment especially against a tyrannical government. \nI mean where were you when the Black Panthers marched around Atlanta during the Governor's election carrying firearms holding signs for Democratic representative Stacy Abrahams saying the guns go with the vote while hold what appears to be a Scar 17, which is a similar weapon system that is used mainly by Military Special Forces Team's/Groups, which can be purchase by civilians if your money is right (2A)! Please, Stop the hypocrisy!\n.\n.\n\n#michigan #liberalismisamentaldisorder #conservativememes #nra #sjwcringe #liberalsnowflakes #HRCVideo #PedoVore #TheGreatAwakening #PatriotsFight #WeThePeople  #WhereWeGoOneWeGoAll #QAnon #TheStorm #WakeUp #RedPill #Debate #Politics\u00a0 #trump2020 #redwave #buildthewall #USA #fakenews #CNN #maga #stateoftheunion #joebiden #blacknotdemocrat #biden2020 #coronavirus",
