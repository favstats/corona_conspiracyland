    "description": "Last month, herbalist @organic_olivia helped her parents recover from COVID-19 and shared their recovery journey on her IG stories and page. It was quite remarkable to watch as she navigated, researched and formulated her own herbal tinctures to help her father get better. She now confirms her intuition was correct, that high levels of prevotella, a gut bacteria is present in those with CV. This is why the Z-pak antibiotic works well when combined with #hydroxychloroquine. Zinc, which has antiviral properties, is also included in the drug cocktail. Recent research from France shows that prevatolla, which is a \u201cbacteria\u201d can be infected with the CV virus. .\n.\n.\nWhat Olivia talks about coincides with what David Icke said in his latest video that\u2019s banned on YouTube, Vimeo and FB. This video has been viewed >7 Million times.
