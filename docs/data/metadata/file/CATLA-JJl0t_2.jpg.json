Tell me again how accurate the Covid testing is \ud83e\udd2a \u2022\n\nThe PCR test is in the news again after a man in Georgia, who was scheduled for surgery, tested positive and, four hours later, tested negative. \u2022\n\nLast week, President John Magufuli of Tanzania said he ran a secret experiment on test kits provided by the World Health Organization. \u2022\n\nHe submitted swab samples from a goat, a sheep, and a piece of pawpaw fruit, which is similar to a papaya. \u2022\n\nThe fruit and the goat tested positive for COVID-19. This would be funny if the consequences were not so serious. \u2022\n\nThe economy and personal liberty around the world are being crushed, based on absurdities such as this. \u2022\n\nhttps://thefreethoughtproject.com/covid-19-tests-positive-fruit/ \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#mandatoryvaccinations #fight5G #orderoutofchaos #chaosbydesign #coronavirus #agenda2030 #agenda21 #Event201 #martiallaw #covid1984 #plandemic #problemreactionsolution #conspiracyreality #covidiots #endthelockdown\n#5G #chemtrails\n#climatechangehoax #wtc7 \n#soros #billgates #rothschild #zionists #rockefeller #depopulation #eugenics #technocracy #kill5G  #electromagneticwaronhumanity \u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022",
