    "description": "Those who sacrifice their liberty for safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. \u2015 Benjamin Franklin. Remember this as you cowardly imprison yourself in your home to protect yourself from a lab-made virus that has a 99.99% survival rate. Big Brother is NEVER interested in your safety, but ONLY in your obedience. The endgame of politicians is to turn the world into an open-air prison in which inmates (citizens) obey without question. Politicians are taking your rights away while saying it's for your safety. It's time to wake up. Better live a free life full of risks and adventures than an unfree life full of illusions in a giant prison. All the safety in the world means nothing without freedom. Give me liberty, or give me death!\n#BenjaminFranklin #NewNorm #RevolutionIsTheOnlySolution #Plandemic #ID2020 #MedicalMartialLaw #MedicalMartialLaw2020 #Event201 #NWO #NewWorldOrder #COVID19 #Coronavirus #COVID19Lockdown #Pandemic #PopulationControl #FamilyPlanning #SelfIsolation #ProblemReactionSolution #MassSurveillance #OrwellianNightmare #BigBrother #BigBrotherIsWatching #BigBrotherIsWatchingYou \nSources:\nhttps://is.gd/3VszXE\nhttps://is.gd/ai3AtE",
