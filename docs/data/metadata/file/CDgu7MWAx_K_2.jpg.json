For most countries it is acceptable to take that risk on their shoulders because it is in their national interest,\"\" he said, adding that Astra and regulators were making safety and tolerability a top priority\n\nThe United States, however, already has a law to exclude tort claims from products that help control a public-health crises in the form of the 2005 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness, or PREP Act\n\nLink: https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-astrazeneca-results-vaccine-liability-idUKKCN24V2EN\n\n#covidvaccine #coronavirusvaccine #covidvaccineliability #astrazeneca #Justredpills \n_\n_\n_\n_\n#alltheworldsastage #vaccines #eugenics #astrazeneca #divideandconquer #escapethematrix #bigpharmaiskillingus #allwarsarebankerwars #bigpharma #historyisalie #truthseekers #agenda21 #agenda2030 #wakeupsheeple #newworldorder #zionistagenda #jesuits #thegoyimknow #depopulationagenda #higherawakening #questioneverything",
