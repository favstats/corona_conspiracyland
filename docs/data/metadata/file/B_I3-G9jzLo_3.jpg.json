    "description": "The 1st Amendment \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 is one of the things that makes the USA so unique. Our forefathers fought tyranny and laid down their lives for us to have this. Our constitutional rights are now being removed. I am sure there are many people who believe that it is justified. You have the right to freedom of speech and I honor your opinion. Truly I do (I am not emotionally upset with anyone who believes something different than I do). You have that right because of the beauty of the first amendment and those who died for you to have those rights. However, I will fight for our constitutional rights and liberties to be maintained. @outofshadowsdocumentary #usa #1stamendment #constitution #rights #liberties #freedom #small #government #shutdown #donttreadonme \ud83d\udc0d #opencalifornia #bigbrother #communism #socialism #martiallaw #policestate #coronavirus #medical #propoganda #no #mandatory #vaccine #firefauci #bigpharma \ud83d\udeab #outofshadows #red pill #rabbithole #Q #qanon",
