    "description": "This is unreal! The fear mongering wasn\u2019t enough. So now, the government and Yale University are trying to determine using which different techniques to coerce people into taking vaccines would be most effective. Among the different options being studied, shaming people using GUILT, EMBARRASSMENT or ANGER to \u201cencourage\u201d and coerce people to take vaccines will be evaluated.\n.\nDo NOT let science die! If you have not shared anything with anyone yet, this is the most important thing to share so that the ones with their heads in the sand can now be asked a simple question:\n.\nIf this \u201cPLANdemic\u201d was so real, why do we need to study ways to convince people to take a vaccine? Do we study different ways of making people buy cars? Or go to restaurants? Do we study shaming people and making them feel guilty to do anything in any other sector or industry on our planet? Sure, we may study buying behaviors. But not using anger, guilt or embarrassment to convince people to do something that could hurt them.\n.\nThe time for each of us to make a difference is upon us. In Berlin Germany, people are protesting against the erosion of freedoms due to the false pandemic. Tens of thousands are rising up. Other parts of the world have similar things starting to happen. Here in the US, more is going to start happening. But don\u2019t wait. Start now! Make a stand. Stop wearing masks. Stop social distancing. Do NOT comply. Do NOT CONSENT!!!\n.\n#covid19 #covidconspiracy #corona #patriots #patriot #qanon #DrButtar #AHEADMAP #AdvancedMedicine #AdvancedMedicineConference #IADFW #Fitness #Longevity #livelonger #livehealthy #power #facts #knowledge #truth #empowerment #livefree #livefreeordie #populationcontrol #whistleblower #soldiers #wechangetheworld #healthfreedom #health #freedom #medicalfreedom",
