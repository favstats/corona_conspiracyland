    "description": "A #California man has been locked in a psychiatric hold after he said he would \u2018have to take things into my own hands\u2019 regarding a theory involving #BillGates, #vaccines and #5G.\nThe Independent reports that the man \u201cwas placed in psychiatric hold for three days while police seized unregistered shotguns from his home.\u201d Citing a #Sa Diego press release, the report notes that police \u201cobtained a Gun Violence Restraining Order against the 52-year-old after he told family and friends about his plan to arm himself during the #Covid19 pandemic.\u201d According to the report, the man claimed the #coronavirus outbreak is \u201can elaborate hoax to scare #Americans into vaccines that made people trackable through 5G towers.\u201d Police got involved when the man allegedly became \u201cenraged\u201d after being denied a purchase of ammunition. The man is said to have expressed a belief that the incident was part of a government plot against him.\nOfficials said, however, that the purchase was denied owing to the man being on probation for a prior drink-driving conviction, which prohibits firearm sales until 2025.\nPolice said that the man began ranting about needing to arm himself against Bill Gates, saying that \u201cpeople are going to try and get me and I need to defend myself\u201d. City Attorney Mara W Elliott commuted that \u201cThanks to public vigilance, police were able to safely intervene and remove firearms from someone who presented a danger to himself and others before he resorted to violence.\u201d #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #ID2020 #Technocracy #ScientificDictatorship",
