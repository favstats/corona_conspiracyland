    "description": "SHOW ME THE LAW!!\"\" -- The Healthy American Peggy Hall \u201cShow me the law!\u201d I personally no longer want to debate the science about wearing masks\u2026 Even if the mask was a magic mask and allowed me to live to be 120 years old, I still want to see the law that compels me as an individual to wear one. I choose the health behaviors that suit me\u2026 And you choose the health behaviors that suit you. No governor, no mayor, no individual can require me to engage in health intervention without my consent. .\n.\nJoin me at www. TheHealthyAmerican.org to get on the email list and I will give you a lot more support and taking action to stand for truth and freedom..\n.\nAlso Go to - Healthy American Peggy Hall on YouTube for all the videos.\n.\nYou can also follow her at: @peggythehealthyamerican\n.\n.\npeggyhall #thehealthyamerican\n#nomaskday #maskoff #nomask #wearamask (if you wanna die) #endmedicaltyranny #orangecounty #medicaltyranny #billgatesisevil #firefauci #coronavirus #scamdemic #icantbreathe #blacklivesmatter #alllivesmatter #drbuttar #filmyourhospital #maskfree #recallgavinnewsom\n #virusesareNOTcontagious\n#recallnewsom #savecalifornia\n#takebackcalifornia",
