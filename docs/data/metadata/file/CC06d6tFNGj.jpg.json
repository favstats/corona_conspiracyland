    "description": "So I was walking around in the old town of Marbella and a woman looked mad at me and called me estupida ... So with my \u201cstupid head\u201d I thought it was probably because I didn\u2019t wear a mask.. So I asked her in English why she was mad. Her response was that I just want to be \u201cpretty\u201d and because of my selfishness I\u2019m killing people ...\ud83d\ude44So I looked around ... and told her that I didn\u2019t see any dead bodies ... Did she? Her response was you know what I mean.... And of course I told her no I don\u2019t .... If your mask works ... then why in godsname should you be afraid??? The end!!! She looked pissed... shook her head and walked away .... Why don\u2019t they ever have a good argument??? \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23#masksareforidiots\n\n\u2063 \u2063 \u2063\n\u2063 \u2063 \u2063 \u2063\n\u2063 \u2063 \u2063\n\n#speakup #truthseeker #plandemic  #nonewnormal #freedom #summerday #wwg1wga  #agenda2030 #brunettesdoitbetter #saynotobillgates #scamdemic #zegneetegenanderhalvemeter #standthefuckup  #covid19 #rebelonaroll",
