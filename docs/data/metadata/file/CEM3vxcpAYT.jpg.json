    "description": "#Perspective I have always held the point of view that nursing homes are essentially prisons for those who wish to have never been involuntarily placed in them. And there's a lot of these cases. Yes there are cases where some people require 24/7 care and have to be there but need I remind you statists: regardless if you think its for their health and safety? You have no right to deny these human beings freedom if they wish to leave and if you do? You are a freedom abusing tyrant. Regardless of what excuse you use to justify it. #Covid19 #Covid #CoronaVirus #Lockdown #NursingHomes #PrisionsForTheElderly #PopulationControl #KillswitchEngaged #Event201 #Plandemic #Agenda21 #Agenda2030",
