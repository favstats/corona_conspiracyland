I do not consent to aborted fetal cells, chemicals, antibiotics, or animal DNA being injected into my children that injury and kill in the name of fake science for profit by fake media.  I do not consent to harming my children while my constitutional rights are slowly stripped away. I do consent to mine and my children\u2019s bodily autonomy, medical freedom, and right to an education free through coercion and lies.  I humbly admit I\u2019ve made many mistakes. Mistakes that hurt myself and others I now have to  live with the rest of my life, but that doesn\u2019t cripple me to stay silent. I will continue to share my experiences, strength, and hope in effort to empower others.  I\u2019ve learned to share the truth respectfully, to advocate for justice, and to above all live in freedom from bondage consumed by peace, hope, and love.  I pray we can all learn to be Lions not Sheep. .\n.\n.\n.\n#humanitynotavirus #virus #corona #nofear #immunesystem  #virusesareNOTcontagious #terraintheory  #truthseekers #wakeup #unbearables #notmyvirus  #SocialDistancing #yoga #filmyourhospital #fearisthevirus #covid #plandemic #coronaviruspandemic #conspiracytheoriesandchill #healthyliving #healthandwellness #WeAreTheNewsNow #falseflag\n#coronavirus #covid  #wearethenewsnow #citizenjournalist\n#londonrealarmy",
