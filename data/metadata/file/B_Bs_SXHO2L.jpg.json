    "description": "Do you ever look up the etymology and root origins of words? Virus means poison. And it\u2019s just like Dr Thomas Cowan talks about... a \u201cvirus\u201d is nothing more than the body trying to rid the body of poisons. A fever is ESSENTIAL for the body to heal and detoxify! Viruses are not real! The germ theory is a hoax and this is proven! A virus has never ever been isolated in a lab, put into another organism, and been shown to cause disease. Never once!! Ok..so let\u2019s get this out of the way. Did-ease is caused by toxins... mental toxins, emotional toxins, chemical toxins, heavy metal toxins. A \u201cvirus\u201d is the result. It is our ENVIRONMENT which determines genetic expression, and makes us sick. Again, not gErMs.... Germ theory won over the terrain theory as a political agenda to instigate fear. We can get into that later. But for now, you have got to stop being scared of getting sick!! This is out of control. The paranoia and fear among people right now is the real virus!!\n#terraintheory #germtheory #virus #virushoax #virusesarentreal #medicalmafia #poison #fever #thebodyheals #stress #fear #plandemic #scamdemic #covid #covid19 #fakenews #fakevirus",
