I wanted to cry. Fuck this \u201cvirus\u201d people were already scared of each other before now it\u2019s gotten too extreme, and this is just the beginning. May Yah have mercy on our sins, ignorance, and stupidity.\n\n-Second video: listen closely to the lyrics, this song is completely based on the Bible.\n#5gvirus #coronais5g #stop5g #stop5gnow #thevirus #corona #coronavirus #stayhome #keepyourheadup #breathdeep #quarantine #coronaisolation #wtfu #wakeup #firmament #nasalies #governmentlies",
