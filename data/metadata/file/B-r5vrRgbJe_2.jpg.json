    "description": "We have been talking about thi as  the reason the hospitals may be lying and fabricating numbers.  When it comes to the state level they are responsible for their medical systems . In some other states such as New York and california you have medical systems that were on the brink of collapse this is especially true in New York where they were maybe a year off from a total system failure. We have brought forth a lot of evidence showing that the hospitals have been counting deaths that may have NOTHING to do with the virus . They can only keep up this false reporting for so long especially when the virus is not doing what they want it to do . Now that we are seeing a dramatic decline in infection cases and deaths \"\"\"\"caused\"\"\"\" by covid 19, It sparks the question in everyone's mind , why? Now we are witnessing a great back tracking becuase they are trying to cover thier asses as much as possible before the news blows wide open . We will get to dr Fauci and his ties to the not only big pharma but also to vaccines and the Gates family and why he spread so much fear and panic . Stay hungry .\n.\n.\n#dontbelievethelies #dontbelievethehype #bigthingshappening #backroundnoise #deepstate #hospital #filmyourhospital #clintons #distraction #hoax #corona #virus #coronavirus #hystaria #media #manipulation #panic #wwg1wga #anon #q #unreal #lies #msm #mainstreammedia #news #investigativejournalism #truth",
