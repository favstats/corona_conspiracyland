    "description": "Remember that the best illusions are performed while the audience is watching but completely distracted. I just wanted to clarify with everyone about what I have been posting and the responses I have been getting. I am not here to be your enemy at all. I am posting what I post for a bigger cause because this is actually not common knowledge (as much as it should be but can\u2019t) because of how much it is censored. There are power plays being made and decisions about laws that we have no say in being made. Our freedoms are being taken away right under our noses, but people can\u2019t see that with that mask on. Everyone is so dam busy arguing about the mask when the bigger at hand issue is our children being raped and killed for pleasure. Do you see? The big distraction behind the illusion now? I hope so.\n.\n#event201 #plandemic2020 #pedoisland #epsteinisland #lockstep #billgatesisevil #covid19 #avicii #pedowood",
