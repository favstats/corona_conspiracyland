This comes to 9,683\u00a0deaths.\nThe top conditions contributing to deaths involving coronavirus disease include influenza and pneumonia, respiratory failure, hypertensive disease, diabetes, vascular and unspecified dementia, cardiac arrest, heart failure, renal failure, intentional and unintentional injury and poisoning, the report shows.\nThe numbers released by the CDC are based on \u201cprovisional death counts,\u201d and the agency says that\u2019s most reliable to \u201cdeliver the most complete and accurate picture of lives lost to COVID-19.\u201d\nIt explains that \u201cthey are based on death certificates, which are the most reliable source of data and contain information not available anywhere else, including comorbid conditions, race and ethnicity, and place of death.\u201d\nThe CDC defines comorbidity as having \u201cmore than one disease or condition \u2026 present in the same person at the same time.\u201d\n\u201cConditions described as comorbidities are often chronic or long-term conditions. Other names to describe comorbid conditions are coexisting or co-occurring conditions and sometimes also \u2018multimorbidity\u2019 or \u2018multiple chronic conditions.\u2019\u201d\n.\n.\n.\n#dontbelievethelies #dontbelievethehype #school #socialdistancing\u00a0 #deepstate #hospital #filmyourhospital #1984 #distraction #hoax #corona #virus #plandemic #hystaria #media #manipulation #panic #wwg1wga #anon #q #unreal #lies #msm #mainstreammedia #news #investigativejournalism #truth #freedom #givemelibertyorgivemedeath #conspiracytheory",
