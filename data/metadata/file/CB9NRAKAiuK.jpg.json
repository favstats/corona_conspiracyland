    "description": "The police are public servants here for the people. When\u2019s the last time you felt safe around officers? When you spot one while driving do you go as far to turn your radio down? In many communities I\u2019m sure people feel the officers make their communities a better place. I can only speak for myself but I\u2019ve never had a good experience if police had to be present. The cops I\u2019ve come across have seemed to forget the main objective is to protect and serve not solely serve. The cops I\u2019ve come across have had inflated egos because they carried the badge and didn\u2019t think I knew my rights. When did it stop being about protecting the people? Oh wait it was never really about that. .\n.\n.\n.\n#taxes #taxationistheft #freedomofspeech #corruptgovernment #corruptions #truth #nwo #newworldorder #freedom #propaganda #liberty #anarchy #antistate #conspiracy #capitalism #democracy #socialism #society #knowyourrights #thinkforyourself #populationcontrol #covid19 #WWG1WGA #wakeup #agenda21 #wedonotconsent #covid",
