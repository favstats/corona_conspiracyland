A Washington state sheriff told a group of people that wearing a mask made them a \u201csheep,\u201d video shows. \u201cIn case you guys didn\u2019t hear, Governor Inslee, in his infinite wisdom, has decided after over 100-some-odd days, that we should all wear face masks, inside and out,\u201d Lewis County Sheriff Rob Snaza said in the video. \u201cHere\u2019s what I say, don\u2019t be a sheep.\u201d Gov. Jay Inslee announced that face masks would be mandatory while in public across the state starting June 26 to help slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nSheriff Snaza added:\n\u201cWhat I meant by \u2018don\u2019t be a sheep\u2019 is what I meant is \u2018don\u2019t just be a follower,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAsk questions. You have the right to say \u2018why do I have to do this? Why are people going and trying to take away our First Amendment rights?\u2019 Stand up, fight for yourself and just be that leader that we\u2019re looking for in our community.\u201d Link:\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.newsobserver.com/news/nation-world/national/article243830352.html\n\n@value_for_viral \n#killilluminati #newworldorder #nw #mindcontrol #brainwashed #mkultra #theearthisflat #thirdeye #conspiracytheory #conspiracytheories #stopwearingmasks #wakethemasses #stoplies #projectbluebeam #alien #truth #truther #truthseeker #truthhurts #truthersunite #truthisstrangerthanfiction #truthhiddeninplainsight #butterflyeffect #truthunedited #mask #mkultraexposed #truthlife #theendisnear #wakethesheeple #coronavirus",
