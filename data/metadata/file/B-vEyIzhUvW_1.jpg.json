    "description": "Update 4/9 Now the current projection is down from 2million deaths to 60,000 estimated deaths. (60,000 to 80,000 die during regular flu season yearly)\n\nOriginal: This man has been in his position since 1984 and has never gotten it right, he has cried wolf to many times. His recommendations to responding to this pandemic have been tyrannical at the very least. The mortality projections and all the models have been negligently wrong and he is responsible for this economic downturn that is coming upon us all hard. If you are not working or have had to close your business down thank #anthonyfauci and his incompetence. \n#firefauci #fireanthonyfauci #coronavirus #covid #freedom #liberty #persuitofhappiness #ar15 #fuckbillgates #2a #libertarian #who #cdc",
