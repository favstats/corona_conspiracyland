    "description": "Take me back to when life was as simple as beach forts and naked babies ! \nIncredible what five months can do - mask mandates , travel restrictions , closed beaches total government overreach ! \nSocial conditioning phrases like \u201c new normal \u201c and \u201c social distancing \u201c are words I will never accept . \nIt went from 2 weeks to slow the spread - five months later many places including Hawaii going into more lockdowns and our freedoms being taken away one by one . Even though  now we know this virus is NOT any where near as deadly as they said back in March . They are treating it the same because the virus is and has always being a smoke screen . They want us afraid , if we are afraid we are easily controlled. They want us divided because if we are too busy telling on our neighbors for having some friends over or A family having a picnic on the beach we will not stand united against them . United we stand divided we fall . It\u2019s that simple . \nAsk your self what kind of word you want your child to live in . I guaranteed you it\u2019s nothing like where we are heading if more people don\u2019t stand up . Call your state representatives , educate your friend.  There is no way the 1 percent can control the 99%  if we are united .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#nonewnormal #covid1984 #georgeorwell1984 #plandemic2020 #fakenews #cov\u0131d19 #wearethe99percent #thegreatawakening #3dto5d #standtogether",
