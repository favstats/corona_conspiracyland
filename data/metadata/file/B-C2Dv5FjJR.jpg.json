'Broward, Dade and Palm Beach, almost 50% of the cases in Florida are in those areas,' DeSantis said Saturday. 'The Miami-Dade site is due at Hard Rock Stadium.' On Monday the testing site will be open from 9am to 5pm for individuals 65 or older who exhibit COVID-19 symptoms as well as for all first responders and healthcare workers even if they do not show symptoms.\nNurses will be on site to screen people for eligibility and people who do not meet testing criteria will be turned away.\nThe Florida Army National Guard will then conduct nasal swabs and the test results will be available in about 48 to 72 hours.\nAs of Sunday morning there are 763 cases of coronavirus in Florida and there have been at least 12 deaths.\n#JesusIsComing #SignsOfTheTimes  #Health #Tukkit  #MartialLaw #NewYork  #Virus #NYC #FalseFlag #Truth #WakeUp #OpenYourEyes #Manhattan  #COVid_19 #NewWorldOrder #MarkOfTheBeast #Awakening #Miami #Hardrock #WakeUp #EndTimes #ComingSoon #Prepare #Technology",
