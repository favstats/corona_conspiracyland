    "description": "Corporate media, which we all know is in the business of manufacturing consent for the banking class and the political class, is praising a wage-salve at Costco for denying service to a customer who didn't want to wear a mask. The deplorable slave who works for Costco took the customer's cart away and asked him to leave. They're calling this employee a \"\"hero\"\" now \ud83e\udd23. This is the United Slaves of America, folks, where corporations control the country and tell people what to do. What the hell happened to the slogan \"\"the customer is always right\"\"? And although wearing these masks NEVER protects you from viruses, the sheeple obediently put them on and walk around in blissful ignorance as they happily suffocate themselves in their own CO2. Why? Because they're idiots who were told by their overlords that it's for their safety. Funny that the line \"\"it's for your safety\"\" is exactly what the Nazis used to control the German population during WW2. America is the new Nazi Germany. \n#ItsForYourSafety #ForYourSafety #Costco #ProblemReactionSolution #Plandemic #ID2020 #MedicalMartialLaw #MedicalMartialLaw2020 #Event201 #NWO #NewWorldOrder #HouseArrest #HouseArrestForEveryone #COVID19 #Coronavirus #COVID19Lockdown #Pandemic #PopulationControl #FamilyPlanning #SelfIsolation #NewNorm #ProblemReactionSolution #MassSurveillance #OrwellianNightmare #BigBrother #BigBrotherIsWatching #BigBrotherIsWatchingYou #VoteForNobody #DontVoteRevolt #EveryVoteHurts #RevolutionIsTheOnlySolution\n\nSources:\nhttps://is.gd/YbBS5Z\nhttps://is.gd/bAPHHZ",
