THAT EVERY TIME WE LIVE YOUR HOUSE ITS A CHANCE YOU COULD GET KILLED.\n@mikeupshur\n\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\nListen to the concern of the 2 year old son as his dad goes to bring the trash bins back to the front of the house. \u2063\n\u2063\nDad: Don\u2019t come outside \u2063\nSon: I\u2019m just gonna watch you. \u2063\n**Dad proceeds outside to get the trash bins**\u2063\nSon: Daddy?\u2063\nDad: yeah?\u2063\nSon: ARE YOU GONNA GET SHOT?\u2063\nDad: No\u2063\nSon: Oh! \u2063\n\u2063\nThe scary thing is that it\u2019s so common, even a 2 year old comprehends the danger of his dad simply stepping outside the door. \u2063\n\nWhile the world only has to deal with the CORONAVIRUS. Black people still have to deal with #Racism and #PoliceBrutality. Smh The attack on our people never stops. \n#GeorgeFloyd\n#AhmaudArbery\n#SeanReed\n#BreonaTaylor \n#POPULATIONCONTROL \n#corona  #coronavirus  #Hr6666 #TraceAct #COVID19 #Shutdown #Martiallaw #quarantine  #pandemic #5G #Vaccination \u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\u2796\n\u201cTHIS IS SO WE NEVER FORGET WHY WE\u2019RE DOING THIS\u201d \u201cTURN ON POST NOTIFICATIONS\u201d.
