Gates\u2019 vision was to force America\u2019s failed system of GMO, chemical, and fossil fuel-based agriculture on African farmers. They spent a billion dollars imposing high-tech corporatized, industrialized agriculture, forcing small farms to transition to imported commercial seeds, petrochemical fertilizers, and pesticides. Gates built the supply chain infrastructure for chemicals and seeds and persuaded African governments to spend huge sums on subsidies and to use authoritarian penalties to force farmers to buy his expensive inputs. As with his African vaccine enterprise, there was no public evaluation or accountability. \u201cFalse Promises: The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA)\u201d is the report card on that 14-year effort. The report concludes that the number of Africans suffering extreme hunger has increased by 30 percent in the 13 countries that Gates targeted.\n\nGates made farmers substitute traditional nutritious subsistence crops like sorghum, millet, sweet potato, and cassava for high-yield industrial cash crops, especially corn, which benefit elite commodity traders but leave poor Africans with little to eat. Both nutrition and productivity plummeted. Soils grew more acidic with every application of petrochemical fertilizers. Rural poverty increased, and the number of hungry people in these 13 countries rose to 131 million people.\n\nThe only entities benefiting from Gates\u2019 program were his international corporate parties\u2014particularly Monsanto. Africans call Gates\u2019 program \u201cNeocolonialism\u201d.\n\ud83c\udff9\n#newworldorder #nwo #tolak5g #StopGMO #berdikari #konspirasi #PandemicCurrency #conspiracy #stop5g #stop5gbali #stop5gindonesia #stopgmoindonesia #covid19 #digitalcurrency #psbb #indonesiaberdikari #5G #newnormal #agenda201 #NoGMO #KillGates #GMO #id2020 #TheOldOfIntelligentsia #StopGMO #indonesian_flatearth_society\n#indonesiantruthseekersociety",
