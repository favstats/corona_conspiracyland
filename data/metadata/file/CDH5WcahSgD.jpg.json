    "description": "800,000 children go missing per year in the United States alone; that is 2,200 children per day. It is estimated that 40 million people are \u201cmodern day slaves\u201d worldwide. \n.\nEstimates suggest that, internationally, only about .04% survivors of human trafficking cases are identified, meaning that the vast majority of cases of human trafficking go undetected.\n.\n\nHuman trafficking earns global profits of roughly $150 billion a year for traffickers, $99 billion of which comes from commercial sexual exploitation.\n.\nChildren are not at risk for covid, and surely not anywhere near the way they are at risk for abduction. Masks are only giving perpetrators easier access and tools to take our children. \n.\nPlease fight for your child\u2019s rights to not wear a mask.\n.\n#wwg1wga #wwg1wgaworldwide #nonewnormal #q #qanon #covid_19 #qarmy #truth #truthseeker #weareinthistogether #wearethenewsnow #health #wellness #saynotobillgates #arrestbillgates #holisitichealth #healthykids  #keepkidssafe #kidsneedmore #safetyfirst #humantrafficking #keepchildrensafe  #medicalfreedomactivist #freedom",
