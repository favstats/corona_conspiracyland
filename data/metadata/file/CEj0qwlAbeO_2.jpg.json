    "description": "Nobody had the statistics that could show, truthfully, that is, how many caught the virus versus how many died from the virus versus how many fully recovered from the virus versus how many carried the virus in their systems, but felt no symptoms.\nIt was a full-speed-ahead torpedoing of America\u2019s businesses, America\u2019s economy, America\u2019s social outlets, America\u2019s schools, America\u2019s churches. Stay home, stay off the streets, wait for the taxpayer stimulus check to buy some food, to pay some bills. Devastation. Destruction. Suicidal \u2014 and suicide-driving, sad to say.\nNow the CDC\u00a0finds\u00a0this: \u201cTable 3 shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). For 6% off the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 26 additional conditions or causes per death.\u201d\nLike what?\nLike\u00a0influenza and pneumonia. Like respiratory ailments and failures; Like high blood pressure and diabetes. Like vascular conditions and even dementia. Like heart troubles and heart failures. Even, like poisonings.\nIn layman\u2019s, that means that all the people who\u2019ve died from COVID-19, haven\u2019t, well, quite actually, truly, reaaallly died from COVID-19.\nIt\u2019s like this: A guy goes to the hospital for treatment of a heart attack. The doctor finds his blood pressure soaring, and his vascular system in distress. He\u2019s having difficulty breathing \u2014 he shows signs of respiratory failure. Hmm, which came first, the breathing problem or the heart attack? Could it be the breathing difficulty is attributed to the cold clamp on blood flow to his heart? Could be, could be. No matter \u2014 the guy tests positive for COVID-19. It\u2019s a COVID-19 death\n.\n.\n.\n#dontbelievethelies #dontbelievethehype #school #socialdistancing\u00a0 #deepstate #hospital #filmyourhospital #1984 #distraction #hoax #corona #virus #plandemic #hystaria #media #manipulation #panic #wwg1wga #anon #q #unreal #lies #msm #mainstreammedia #news #investigativejournalism #truth #freedom #givemelibertyorgivemedeath #conspiracytheory",
