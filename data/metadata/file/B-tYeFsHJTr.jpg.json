Smh The attack on our people never stops. \n#POPULATIONCONTROL \n#corona  #coronavirus  #COVID19 #Shutdown #Martiallaw #quarantine  #pandemic #5G #Vaccination\n#Coronachallege #coronamemes \nJason Anglero-Wyrick, Had  his hands in the air and surrendering to police. When they viciously unleashed a violent fury upon him. The video begins with Anglero-Wyrick standing behind his girlfriend, Naustachia Green,  with his hands up in the air.\n\nWhen police control the narrative all you get is lies they said, \u201cdeputies grabbed Green and pulled her away from Anglero-Wyrick who allegedly headed toward the house. A sheriff\u2019s office K-9 bit Anglero-Wyrick on the right leg and Anglero-Wyrick was handcuffed after an apparent struggle.\u201d However, if you watch the video below, that is not at all what happened. Green was standing in front of Anglero-Wyrick as the couple both had their arms in the air. All of the sudden, for no apparent reason, a cop shoots Anglero-Wyrick with his taser causing him to fall to the ground. Proving just how compliant he was, in some amazing show of discipline, Anglero-Wyrick \u2014 after just being tasered \u2014 immediately placed his hand behind his back. He was face-down on the ground, with his hands in his lower back waiting for handcuffs and not a threat to anyone.Despite these facts and despite another officer moving in to handcuff Anglero-Wyrick, the K-9 officer released his vicious dog and it began tearing into Anglero-Wyrick\u2019s leg. The dog latches onto Anglero-Wyrick\u2019s right leg at approximately 8 seconds into the video. Incredibly enough, Anglero-Wyrick keeps his hands behind his back \u2014 resisting the urge to writhe in pain \u2014 as the dog shreds his calf muscle to pieces. \u2022 Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"\"\"\"fair use\"\"\"\" for purposes such as criticism. commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
