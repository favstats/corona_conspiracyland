You are wearing and using them incorrectly and if they weren\u2019t already ineffective (the majority of the ones I see people wearing) they are made ineffective by your practices. Therefore all it serves to do is control you and give you and others a false sense of security. Only wear if you are REQUIRED to and even then...PUSH BACK because it\u2019s ridiculous!! Enjoy that fresh Spring air people!! .\n#BlackLivesMatter #Islam #love #BLM #JoeBiden\u00a0#racism  #keepamericagreat\u00a0#wakeupamerica #greatawakening #maga #makeamericagreatagain #america #draintheswamp #qanon #occupydemocrats #wethepeople #thisisamerica #sheepnomore #unitednotdivided #redpill #wwg1wga #q #takebackcontrol #usa #coronavirus #covid19 #flattenthecurve #nonewnormal #saynotobillgates",
