Whether life was normal before the virus is debatable, and whether it will be once we\u2019re done dealing with it is why we have to persevere today. Governments around the world are beginning to synchronize their responses to the virus in a lockstep-style formation, but as this takes place, American\u2019s are gradually learning who has funded such a complex plan.\n\nThe rest of the nation, and eventually the rest of the world, is beginning to wake up to the deeds of Bill Gates. For almost two weeks now, his social media handles have been flooded with calls for his arrest because of his perceived hidden actions. With this expose taking place, almost simultaneously, funding from the World Health Organization is frozen in their deliberate attempt to censor critical information.\n\nThere is no easy way to say this, but regardless of who the culprit may be, a reckoning is being summoned. Not only do people want life back before the surveillance, but they also thirst for justice and answers to such a heinous act. The only problem is in this Hegelian dialectic, the very same people who caused the problem are being called upon to provide a solution. The most obvious answer usually isn\u2019t the right one, but as time goes, I suppose we\u2019ll all see.\n\n#FactionsOfFreedom #FreedomFaction #Podcast #AlternativeNews #ConsciousMedia #TruthSeeker #Killuminati #Technocracy #NewWorldOrder #ScientificDictatorship #Agenda21 #Agenda2030 #Coronavirus #CoViD19 #CoViD1984 #SurveillanceState #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda #VaccineAgenda #Event201 #OperationGridlock",
