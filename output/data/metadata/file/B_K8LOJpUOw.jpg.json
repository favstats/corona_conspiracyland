    "description": "Discern everything from your heart\u2019s center. Your mind can easily play tricks on you but the heart never lies. Be aware of your intention(s) and any reaction that you may have. Our emotions are indicators of where we are vibrationally. If you\u2019re in lower vibration, the truth can be easily distorted. If you\u2019re in a higher vibration, the truth will make itself known. The trick is to try to remain or return to a higher vibration. You will never be misguided if you remain here. \u2764\ufe0f .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nvia @andriettalee .\n.\n.\n#discern #observe #thinkforyourself #truthseeker #truth #thegreatawakening #wwg1wga #darktolight #patriot #conspiracytheory #coronavirus #covid19 #redpill #selfmastery #medicalfreedom #nonduality #nofear #fearless #fearmongering #maga #adrenochrome #fuckbillgates #saynotobillgates #lightworker #newearth #fakenews #qanon #freedom #spiritualawakening #higherconsciousness",
