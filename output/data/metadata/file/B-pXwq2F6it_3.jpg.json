This is the scene.\n\u2800\nIs your mind Twisted yet?\n\u2800\nThose who crave power over others are unaware of their own authority. They\u2019re afraid and so suppress others to create artificial superiority. It\u2019s a compensation for the feeling of powerlessness. It\u2019s an illusion. If you do this, recognize it and make a choice.\n\u2800\nWhat if fear of the virus is what activated it? Would you still choose fear?\n\u2800\nWhat if it\u2019s all true? Would it matter? Or is it just entertainment?\n\u2800\nWhat if you\u2019re wrong? What if I\u2019m wrong? Does it change anything?\n\u2800\nThere\u2019s ALWAYS a choice.\n.\n.\n.\n#covid19 #coronavirus #pandemic #markofthebeast #qanon #5G #ascension #newage #hollowearth #datamining #eugenics #adrenochrome #sextrafficking #counterculture #simulation #inflammation #crowdcontrol #socialengineering #lightanddark #selfhealing #accountability #herobecomesvillain #mintzflow",
