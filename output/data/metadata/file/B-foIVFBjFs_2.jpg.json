These beautiful children don\u2019t deserve to be harmed daily and lied to about how they got cancer to protect a business interest or new technology fuck all this technology when it comes to the children of the future and fuck these companies that don\u2019t see any value in us except for our earning power and spending habits that\u2019s all they see us as slaves and consumers and we must change the tables my ppl #explore #explorepage #share #repost #questioneverything #staywoke #5G #essential #virus #corona #covid19 #eachoneteachone #knowledgeispower #doyourresearch #quarantine #quarantinelife #event201 #radiationpoisoning #cbs13 #california",
