    "description": "So, this just got introduced....hasn't became law yet. The message that needs to be sent to the masses is this. Call your local representatives and tell them to go up the chain against this. Then you call your state representative and tell them you dont want this, and if they vote to pass this you won't vote for them next go about. The people have to put pressure on their voted representatives and hold them accountable for their actions. If not, they gonna do whatever they want, and people will go crazy, take to the streets....and everyone will get shot!\n\nSO I ASK AGAIN WHY DO WE AS BLACK PEOPLE TRUST THIS SYSTEM AT ALL?? #POPULATIONCONTROL \n#corona  #coronavirus  #HR6666 #COVID19 #Shutdown ##TraceAct #Martiallaw #quarantine  #pandemic #5G #Vaccination\n#Coronachallege #coronamemes\nThere is a genocide going on in the black community. Our young children are going missing and we all know it\u2019s for organs and human trafficking. If they are not being kidnapped, our people are being killed, murdered by police and by people on the street who are protected by the police. If they dont  get us in the streets the court system is illegally and unjustly sending our black people away for LIFE SENTENCES. On every level we are being attacked. If we don\u2019t start supporting our own and building our own communities . They will always control us and our CHILDREN. We will be leaving a situation worse than we are in NOW, for the Next GENERATION. Does that not scare YOU, it should? That our children may have to fight an even harder fight, than the one we are fighting right NOW. That our ignorance THE FACT WE CAN NOT STOP FIGHTING EACH OTHER will be the bullet that kills our children\u2019s future. Think about that for a second. History is repeating itself. Are we going to act like we don\u2019t see it ???? Until we unite and support our own. We must take responsibility for allowing them to do this to us.
