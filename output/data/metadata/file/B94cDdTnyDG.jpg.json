Ok.....so...lemme humour the guidelines and lemme get this straight - we have to wash our hands to stay corona free right? \ud83d\ude43\nSo, we have our corona ridden hands full of virus....we turn on the tap leaving all the germs on it.....we wash our hands just like the news showed us (cos obviously we didn't already know how to do that) and then....we turn the tap back off.....and the virus is right back on our hands form the fact we already touched the tap isn't it? \ud83d\ude43\nThen we dry our hands....putting the virus on our towel and later we might wash our face, use the towel and spread it there.....am I missing some thing? \ud83d\ude43\nAlso, while I'm at the supermarket bulk buying quinoa, my sleeves might touch the basket handle, or a shelf and also whether I'm wearing gloves or not I obviously have to touch my bag to get my money and then I touch my purse and maybe my phone while I'm  waiting in the long queue....so now all THOSE things are contaminated! Then I touch my car key, my steering wheel, my house keys......so all of THOSE things are contaminated so tell me......unless I'm continuously sterilizing all those things before they come in my house or before I touch them again....aren't I just back to square 1? \ud83d\ude43\nThen I touch  the shopping bag handles and bring the bags in my house.... I mean I don't know who wrote these guidelines..... but they sure didn't have OCD \ud83d\ude43\n\ud83d\ude43\nUnfortunely this beautiful basin isn't mine and nor is this view and I don't know who to credit cos I found it like this on Pinterest.....while I was day dreaming about my post apocalyptic life where things actually make sense \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 #newworldorder #policestate #martiallaw #fakenews #illuminati #bilderberg #rothschild #dontbelievethehype #corona #event201 #rockefeller #humanrights #freedomofmovement",
