    "description": "Fairly good speech from Icke. I\u2019ve never been much of a fan of David since he has history of holocaust denial and believes that reptilians are among us but he knocked a lot of points on the head here mainly directed towards the poor scientific approach to Covid 19 (which is real but far less of a deadly virus as we were led to believe) There was no need for lockdowns or the extreme measures that we have in place, a city in Brazil has recently achieved herd immunity with no lockdowns and Sweden is nearly there. I was lucky to be in the crowd for this event, which amounted to 35,000 people, as they had a number of accredited doctors speaking. I can\u2019t lie, there was a lot of genuinely crazy people there but the majority were typical people upset with the approaches taken. By crazy I\u2019m talking about the people walking around with anti 5G signs and those in the crowd that were chanting for executions. I also saw a lot of people supporting the Q movement which is based on disinformation and bullshit. As usual the event was instantly labelled far right but it was far from that. Watching everyone chant \u2018pedophiles\u2019 at ten Downing Street did give me a laugh, the last pedo in there was Edward Heath. #trafalgarsquare #davidicke #standupx #uniteforfreedom #downingstreet #covid19 #coronavirus #lockdown #greatawakening #qanonisajoke #icke #london #conspiracy",
