    "description": "The government said that the Coronavirus causes symptoms like the flu. That means more than half of the people in the world have the coronavirus then because almost everyone is coughing and sneezing everywhere, especially in the winter. The garbage we eat is giving birth to all types of known and unknown disease in our body. Wake up. Change your diet. You CANNOT do \u2018ANYTHING\u2019 about 5G towers but YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR DIET. The food you buy. The people you are around. The things you watch etc. That is our only defence. RAISE YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM or in other words RAISE YOUR \u2018VIBRATION/FREQUENCY via your food intake and lifestyle. Yes, it\u2019s a lifestyle change, not a 1 or 2 day change. A.ction. C.hanges T.hings. ACT now! You are not promised tomorrow or even 5 minutes. .\n.\n#Repost @eattolivenottodie #maskoff #nomask #wearamask (if you wanna die) #virusesareNOTcontagious #billgatesisevil\n#firefauci #coronavirus #scamdemic #immunesystem #thiswasneveraboutavirus #icantbreathe",
