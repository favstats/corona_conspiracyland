    "description": "Serious question here:\nWhere are all the dead people ? Remember when this virus first broke and people were just keeling over in the streets . They were loading \"\"bodies\"\" in the back of trucks ? This happened in the initial month and then boom never again ... What happened to that ? Why is there not news coverage about funeral homes being overrun ? Where is the news coverage about cemeteries not being able to keep up with the amount of bodies that need to be buried ? So I ask you where are all the dead people ???\n.\n.\n.\n#dontbelievethelies #dontbelievethehype #school #socialdistancing\u00a0 #deepstate #hospital #filmyourhospital #1984 #distraction #hoax #corona #virus #coronavirus #hystaria #media #manipulation #panic #wwg1wga #anon #q #unreal #lies #msm #mainstreammedia #news #investigativejournalism #truth #freedom #givemelibertyorgivemedeath",
