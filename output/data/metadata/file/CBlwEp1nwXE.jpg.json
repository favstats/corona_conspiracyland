So, it was two weeks ago.\u201d Last month, in an interview with medical site, STAT News, Dr Fauci confirmed that the coronavirus taskforce, which was created to tackle the pandemic, was meeting less than it did earlier in the year. \u201cI was meeting with him four times a week back, a month or so ago,\u201d Dr Fauci said. \u201cBut as you probably noticed, that the task force meetings have not occurred as often lately. And certainly my meetings with the president have been dramatically decreased,\u201d he added.\n\nLater on in Dr Fauci\u2019s interview on NPR, he claimed that some states did not continue adhering to social distancing measures as well as they could, when they started easing #lockdown.\n\nHe added that groups of people not wearing masks are clearly \u201cincreasing the risk and likely explaining some of the upticks that you\u2019re seeing.\u201d States across the US, started reopening at the end of April, but in the last few weeks, several states have reported an increase in the number of hospitalisations because of the virus. #Plandemic #Event201 #GlobalHealthSecurityAgenda\n@freedom_faction",
