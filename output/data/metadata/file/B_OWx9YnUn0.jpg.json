    "description": "Once upon a time there was an MMR vaccine released in Canada that caused an obscene number of meningitis cases. \nThey pulled the vaccine from the market and the UK bought it up - renamed it - and pushed it out to the people there.\nAgain - this defective MMR vaccine caused numerous meningitis cases. Duh! Some parents also said their children, who were previously healthy, developed severe GI issues immediately following AND regressed into Autism. \nAgain - the vaccine was renamed and sent off to third-world countries where they use them as human lab rats - most not having a choice because they live under tyrants. #ComingToAmerica \nThese people DONT want the vaccines. I\u2019ve seen them on camera say they don\u2019t want them, BECAUSE they\u2019re \u201cSATANIC\u201d. Their words. Unlike Americans and other spoiled and brainwashed industrialized countries - they don\u2019t have the programming in these places - such as fake news and Hellywood - who tell them what to believe and then all the \ud83d\udc11 flock and bow to their idols. \nBy the way - that vaccine mentioned - is the one that Andrew Wakefield was asked to study \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f the UK government shut the study down before it happened and their crime could be exposed - and they blacklisted him and ALL the sheep believed it. I say sheep with love. Wake up.-meghanrose\n#SayNOToBillGates\n#VaccinesKill\n#WeDontWantYourVaccines\n#OrYourMicrochips\n#Coronavirus\n#wakeup",
