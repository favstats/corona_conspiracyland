    "description": "Did you know WE ALL have a form of CV who have had some kind of flu in our lifetime? It's totally normal, we have millions and millions of viruses in us. But the PCR tests they're doing don't test for viruses, they test for RNA and DNA which is easy to prove as they are the basis of all viruses. But as you should know, those viruses only become illnesses when the body is so overwhelmed with toxicity that it needs to create a virus (exosomes) to clean you out. Viruses are NOT transmissible from one person to the next, viruses are NOT contagious! The only way to get a virus is through a injection directly into your bloodstream.This is a scientific fact that you owe yourself and your loved ones and your freedom to research right away. The truth has been out there this whole time. Look into germ theory vs terrain theory and research the doctors in the tags across all platforms. There are also lots of video clips on this channel to get you started. .\nThe truth will set us all free - but it starts with the individual.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#MediaistheVirus #DrShivaAyyadurai\n#DrJohnBergman #exosomes #DrAndyKaufman #protests \n#virusesareNOTcontagious \n#unbearables #jamestrue  #terraintheory\u00a0#truthseekers #notmyvirus\u00a0 #SocialDistancing #yoga #firefauci #fuckBillGates #billgates #ID2020 #event201 #candiceowens #filmyourhospital #flattenthecurve  #AmericaFirst #falseflag #coronavirus #healthandwellness #covid19 #2A #londonrealarmy",
